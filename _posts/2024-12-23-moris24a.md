title: Semi-supervised learning with Noisy Students improves domain generalization
  in optic disc and cup segmentation in uncropped fundus images
abstract: Automated optic disc (OD) and cup (OC) segmentation in fundus images has
  been widely explored for computer-aided diagnosis of glaucoma. However, existing
  models usually suffer from drops in performance when applied on images significantly
  different than those used for training.Several domain generalization strategies
  have been introduced to mitigate this issue, although they are trained and evaluated
  using images manually cropped around the optic nerve head. This operation eliminates
  most sources of domain variation, therefore overestimating their actual ability
  to cope with new, unseen patterns. In this paper, we analyze the most recent and
  accurate methods for domain generalization in OD/OC segmentation by applying them
  on uncropped fundus pictures, observing notorious degradations in their performance
  when trained and evaluated under this setting.To overcome their drawbacks, we also
  introduce a simple semi-supervised learning approach for domain generalization based
  on the Noisy Student framework.Using a Teacher model trained on a combination of
  domains, we pseudo-labeled a dataset of 18.000 originally unlabeled images that
  are then used for training a Student model.This semi-supervised setting allowed
  the Student network to capture additional sources of variability while retaining
  the original cues and patterns used by the Teacher through the weak annotations.Our
  results on eight different public datasets show improvements in every unseen domain
  over all alternative methods, and are available in https://github.com/eugeniaMoris/Noisy_student_ODOC_MIDL_2024.
