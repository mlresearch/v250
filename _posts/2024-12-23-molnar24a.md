title: 'IHCScoreGAN: An unsupervised generative adversarial network for end-to-end
  ki67 scoring for clinical breast cancer diagnosis'
abstract: 'Ki67 is a biomarker whose activity is routinely measured and scored by
  pathologists through  immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, which informs clinicians
  of patient prognosis and guides treatment. Currently, most clinical laboratories
  rely on a tedious, inconsistent manual scoring process to quantify the percentage
  of Ki67-positive cells. While many works have shown promise for Ki67 quantification
  using computational approaches, the current state-of-the-art methods have limited
  real-world feasibility: they either require large datasets of meticulous cell-level
  ground truth labels to train, or they provide pre-trained weights that may not generalize
  well to in-house data. To overcome these challenges, we propose IHCScoreGAN, the
  first unsupervised deep learning framework for end-to-end Ki67 scoring without the
  need for any ground truth labels. IHCScoreGAN only requires IHC image samples and
  unpaired synthetic data, yet it learns to generate colored cell segmentation masks
  while simultaneously predicting cell center point and biomarker expressions for
  Ki67 scoring, made possible through our novel dual-branch generator structure. We
  validated our framework on a large cohort of 2,136 clinically signed-out cases,
  yielding an accuracy of 0.97 and an F1-score of 0.95 and demonstrating substantially
  better performance than a pre-trained state-of-the-art supervised model. By removing
  ground truth requirements, our unsupervised technique constitutes an important step
  towards easily-trained Ki67 scoring solutions which can train on out-of-domain data
  in an unsupervised manner.'
