title: 'DDA: Dimensionality Driven Augmentation Search for Contrastive Learning in
  Laparoscopic Surgery'
abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has the potential for effective representation
  learning in medical imaging, but the choice of data augmentation is critical and
  domain-specific. It remains uncertain if general augmentation policies suit surgical
  applications. In this work, we automate the search for suitable augmentation policies
  through a new method called Dimensionality Driven Augmentation Search (DDA). DDA
  leverages the local dimensionality of deep representations as a proxy target, and
  differentiably searches for suitable data augmentation policies in contrastive learning.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DDA in navigating a large search
  space and successfully identifying an appropriate data augmentation policy for laparoscopic
  surgery. We systematically evaluate DDA  across three laparoscopic image classification
  and segmentation tasks, where it significantly improves over existing baselines.
  Furthermore, DDAÅ› optimised set of augmentations provides insight into domain-specific
  dependencies when applying contrastive learning in medical applications. For example,
  while hue is an effective augmentation for natural images, it is not advantageous
  for laparoscopic images.
