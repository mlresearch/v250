title: 'Train Once, Deploy Anywhere: Edge-Guided Single-source Domain Generalization
  for Medical Image Segmentation'
abstract: 'In medical image analysis, unsupervised domain adaptation models require
  retraining when receiving samples from a new data distribution, and multi-source
  domain generalization methods might be infeasible when there is only a single source
  domain. These will pose formidable obstacles to model deployment. To this end, we
  take the TÌˆrain Once, Deploy Anywhere\"{as} our objective and consider a challenging
  but practical problem: Single-source Domain Generalization (SDG). Meanwhile, we
  note that (i) the medical image segmentation applications where generalization errors
  often come from imprecise predictions at the ambiguous boundary of anatomies and
  (ii) the edge of the image is domain-invariant, which can reduce the domain shift
  between the source and target domain in all network layers. Specifically, we borrow
  the prior knowledge from Digital Image Processing and take the edge of the image
  as input to enhance the model attention at the boundary of anatomies and improve
  the generalization performance on unknown target domains. Extensive experiments
  on three typical medical image segmentation datasets, which cover cross-sequence,
  cross-center, and cross-modality settings with various anatomical structures, demonstrate
  our method achieves superior generalization performance compared to the state-of-the-art
  SDG methods. The code is available at https://github.com/thinkdifferentor/EGSDG.'
