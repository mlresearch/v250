title: Predicting 3D forearm fracture angle from biplanar Xray images with rotational
  bone pose estimation
abstract: 'Two-dimensional X-ray images, while widely used, have limitations to reflect
  3D information of the imaged objects. Several studies have tried to recover such
  information from multiple X-ray images of the same object. Still, those approaches
  often fail due to the unrealistic assumption that the target does not move between
  views and those two views are perfectly orthogonal.A problem where 3D information
  would be highly valuable but is very difficult to assess from 2D X-ray images is
  the measurement of the actual 3D fracture angles in the forearm. To address this
  problem, we propose a deep learning-based method that predicts the rotational movement
  and skeletal posture from biplanar X-ray images, offering a novel and precise solution.Our
  strategy comprises the following steps: (1) automatic segmentation of the ulna and
  radius bones of the forearm on two X-ray images by a neural network; (2) prediction
  of the rotational parameters of the bones by a pose prediction network; (3) automatic
  detection of fracture locations and assessment of the fracture angles on 2D images;
  and (4) reconstruction of the real 3D fracture angle by inferring it from the 2D
  fracture information and the skeleton pose parameters collected from the two images.
  Our experiments on X-ray images show that our method can accurately measure 2D fracture
  angles and infer the pose of the forearm bones. By simulating X-ray images for various
  types of fractures, we show that our method could provide more accurate measurements
  of fracture angles in 3D. We are the first attempt for the fully automatic fracture
  angle measurements on both 2D and 3D versions, and we show the robustness of our
  method even in extreme cases where the two views are highly nonorthogonal.'
