title: Improving Identically Distributed and Out-of-Distribution Medical Image Classification
  with Segmentation-Guided Attention in Small Dataset Scenarios
abstract: We propose a new approach for training medical image classification models
  using segmentation masks, particularly effective in small dataset scenarios. By
  guiding the modelâ€™s attention with segmentation masks toward relevant features,
  we significantly improve accuracy for diagnosing Hydronephrosis. Evaluation of our
  model on identically distributed data showed either the same or better performance
  with improvement up to 0.28 in AUROC and up to 0.33 in AUPRC. Our method showed
  better generalization ability than baselines, improving from 0.02 to 0.75 in AUROC
  and from 0.09 to 0.47 in AUPRC for four different out-of-distribution datasets.
  The results show that models trained on smaller datasets using our approach can
  achieve comparable results to those trained on datasets 25 times larger.
