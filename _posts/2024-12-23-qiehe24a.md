title: 'NcIEMIL: Rethinking Decoupled Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Histopathological
  Slide Classification'
abstract: 'On account of superiority in annotation efficiency, multiple instance learning
  (MIL) has proved to be a promising framework for the whole slide image (WSI) classification
  in pathological diagnosis. However, current methods employ fully- or semi-decoupled
  frameworks to address the trade-off between billions of pixels and limited computational
  resources. This exacerbates the information bottleneck, leading to instance representations
  in a high-rank space that contains semantic redundancy compared to the potential
  low-rank category space of instances. Additionally, most negative instances are
  also independent of the positive properties of the bag. To address this, we introduce
  a weakly annotation-supervised filtering network, aiming to restore the low-rank
  nature of the slide-level representations. We then design a parallel aggregation
  structure that utilizes spatial attention mechanisms to model inter-correlation
  between instances and simultaneously assigns corresponding weights to channel dimensions
  to alleviate the redundant information introduced by feature extraction. Extensive
  experiments on the private gastrointestinal chemotaxis dataset and CAMELYON16 breast
  dataset show that our proposed framework is capable of handling both binary and
  multivariate classification problems and outperforms state-of-the-art MIL-based
  methods. The code is available at: https://github.com/polyethylene16/NcIEMIL.'
