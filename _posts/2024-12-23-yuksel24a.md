title: Style Randomization Improves the Robustness of Breast Density Estimation in
  MR Images
abstract: Breast density, a crucial risk factor for future breast cancer development,
  is defined bythe ratio of fat to fibro-glandular tissue (FGT) in the breast. Accurate
  breast and FGTsegmentation is essential for robust density estimation. Previous
  research on FGT segmen-tation in MRI has highlighted the significance of training
  on both images with and withoutfat suppression to enhance networkâ€™s robustness.
  In this study, we propose a novel dataaugmentation technique to further exploit
  the multi-modal training setup motivated by theresearch in style randomization.
  We demonstrate that the network trained with the pro-posed augmentation is resilient
  to variations in fat content, showcasing improved robustnesscompared to solely training
  with multi-modal data. Our method effectively improves FGTsegmentation, thereby
  enhancing the overall reliability of breast density estimation
