title: Predicting Atrial Fibrillation Treatment Outcome with Siamese Multi-modal Fusion
  and Cardiac Digital Twins
abstract: Atrial fibrillation, the most common heart rhythm disorder, presents challenges
  in treatment due to difficulty pinpointing the patient-specific regions of abnormal
  electrical activity. While biophysical simulations of cardiac electrophysiology
  create a digital twin of atrial electrical activity based on CT or MRI scans, testing
  various treatment strategies on them is time-consuming and impractical on clinical
  timescales.Our proposed pipeline, incorporating Siamese architecture, fuses latent
  representations of multi-modal features extracted from atrial digital twin before
  any therapy and predicts the outcomes of several treatment strategies.A large in-silico
  dataset of 1000 virtual patients, generated from clinical data, was utilized to
  provide the biophysical simulations before (used for feature extraction) and after
  (used for calculating ground truth labels depending on whether atrial fibrillation
  terminates or not) various treatment strategies.  By accurately predicting freedom
  from atrial fibrillation, our pipeline paves the way for personalized atrial fibrillation
  therapy with a fast and precise selection of optimal treatments.
