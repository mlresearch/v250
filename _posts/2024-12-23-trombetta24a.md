title: Weakly supervised deep learning model with size constraint for prostate cancer
  detection in multiparametric MRI and generalization to unseen domains
abstract: Fully supervised deep models have shown promising performance for many medical
  segmentation tasks. Still, the deployment of these tools in clinics is limited by
  the very time-consuming collection of manually expert-annotated data. Moreover,
  most of the state-of-the-art models have been trained and validated on moderately
  homogeneous datasets. It is known that deep learning methods are often greatly degraded
  by domain or label shifts and are yet to be built in such a way as to be robust
  to unseen data or label distributions. In the clinical setting, this problematic
  is particularly relevant as the deployment institutions may have different scanners
  or acquisition protocols than those from which the data has been collected to train
  the model. In this work, we propose to address these two challenges on the detection
  of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) from bi-parametric MRI. We evaluate
  the method proposed by (Kervadec et al., 2018) , which introduces a size constaint
  loss to produce fine semantic cancer lesions segmentations from weak circle scribbles
  annotations. Performance of the model is based on two public (PI-CAI and Prostate158)
  and one private databases. First, we show that the model achieves on-par performance
  with strong fully supervised baseline models, both on in-distribution validation
  data and unseen test images. Second, we observe a performance decrease for both
  fully supervised and weakly supervised models when tested on unseen data domains.
  This confirms the crucial need for efficient domain adaptation methods if deep learning
  models are aimed to be deployed in a clinical environment. Finally, we show that
  ensemble predictions from multiple trainings increase generalization performance.
