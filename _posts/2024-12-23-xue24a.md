title: 'Erase to Enhance: Data-Efficient Machine Unlearning in MRI Reconstruction'
abstract: Machine unlearning is a promising paradigm for removing unwanted data samples
  from a trained model, towards ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and limiting
  harmful biases. Although unlearning has been shown in, e.g., classification and
  recommendation systems, its potential in medical image-to-image translation, specifically
  in image reconstruction, has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper shows
  that machine unlearning is possible in MRI tasks and has the potential to benefit
  for bias removal. We set up a protocol to study how much shared knowledge exists
  between datasets of different organs, allowing us to effectively quantify the effect
  of unlearning. Our study reveals that combining training data can lead to hallucinations
  and reduced image quality in the reconstructed data. We use unlearning to remove
  hallucinations as a proxy exemplar of undesired data removal. Indeed, we show that
  machine unlearning is possible without full retraining. Furthermore, our observations
  indicate that maintaining high performance is feasible even when using only a subset
  of retain data. We have made our code publicly accessible.
