title: 'UltraMAE: Multi-modal Masked Autoencoder for Ultrasound Pre-training'
abstract: Pre-training on a large dataset such as ImageNet followed by supervised
  fine-tuning has brought success in various deep learning-based tasks. However, the
  modalities of natural images and ultrasound images have considerable differences,
  making pre-training on natural images ineffective for ultrasound-related tasks.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified masking-based model for both ultrasound images
  and videos that learns better visual representation than the network with single-modality
  representations. This is the first large-scale generalized ultrasound pre-training
  network that simultaneously utilizes 100,000+ videos and images of different parts
  of the human anatomy such as the liver, bones, heart, thyroids, nerves, etc, making
  the network an effective benchmark pretrained model for any ultrasound-specific
  downstream tasks. We propose a novel method for ultrasound image analysis that utilizes
  an ultrasound-specific confidence map to guide low-level representation learning
  through masked feature acquisition. Our pre-trained network has demonstrated remarkable
  efficacy and versatility in tackling both classification and segmentation tasks
  across a range of ultrasound pathologies, highlighting its potential for widespread
  adoption and impact in the ultrasound field. In addition, we show that our pre-training
  model can be leveraged to learn efficiently with a small number of labeled ultrasound
  images.
