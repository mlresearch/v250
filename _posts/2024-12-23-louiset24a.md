title: 'SepVAE: a contrastive VAE to separate pathological patterns from healthy ones'
abstract: 'Contrastive Analysis VAE (CA-VAEs) is a family of Variational auto-encoders
  (VAEs) that aims at separating the common factors of variation between a \textit{background}
  dataset (BG) (\textit{i.e.,} healthy subjects) and a \textit{target} dataset (TG)
  (\textit{i.e.,} patients) from the ones that only exist in the target dataset. To
  do so, these methods separate the latent space into a set of \textbf{salient} features
  (\textit{i.e.,} proper to the target dataset) and a set of \textbf{common} features
  (\textit{i.e.,} exist in both datasets). Currently, all CA-VAEs models fail to prevent
  sharing of information between the latent spaces and to capture all salient factors
  of variation. To this end, we introduce two crucial regularization losses: a disentangling
  term between common and salient representations and a classification term between
  background and target samples in the salient space. We show a better performance
  than previous CA-VAEs methods on three medical applications and a natural images
  dataset (CelebA).'
