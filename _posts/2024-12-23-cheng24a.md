title: 'MFIF-Net: A Multi-Focal Image Fusion Network for Implantation Outcome Prediction
  of Blastocyst'
abstract: 'Accurately predicting implantation outcomes based on blastocyst developmental
  potential is valuable in in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Clinically, embryologists
  analyze multiple focal-plane images (FP-images) to comprehensively assess embryo
  grades, which is extremely cumbersome and easily prone to inconsistency. Developing
  automatic computer-aided methods for analyzing embryo images is highly desirable.
  However, effectively fusing multiple FP-images for prediction remains a largely
  under-explored issue. To this end, we propose a novel Multiple Focal-plane Image
  Fusion Network, called MFIF-Net, to predict implantation outcomes of blastocyst.
  Specifically, our MFIF-Net consists of two sub-networks: a Core Image Generation
  Network (CI-Gen) and a Key Feature Fusion Network (KFFNet). In CI-Gen, we fuse multiple
  FP-images to generate a core image by pixel-wise weighting since different FP-images
  can have different focus positions. To further capture key features in each FP-image,
  we propose KFFNet to extract key information from the FP-images again and fuse them
  with the core image. In KFFNet, a Fusion Module is designed to capture key information
  of each FP-image, for which Squeeze Multi-Headed Attention is developed to exchange
  features and mitigate computationally intensive issues in attention. Comprehensive
  experiments validate the superiority and the rationality of our MFIF-Net approach
  over state-of-the-art methods in various metrics. Ablation studies also confirm
  the positive impact of each component in our MFIF-Net.'
