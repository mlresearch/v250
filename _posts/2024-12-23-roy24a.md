title: Anomaly-focused Single Image Super-resolution with Artifact Removal for Chest
  X-rays using Distribution-aware Diffusion Model
abstract: Single image super-resolution (SISR) is a crucial task in the field of medical
  imaging. It transforms low-resolution images into high-resolution counterparts.
  Performing SISR on chest x-ray images enhances image quality, aiding better diagnosis.
  However, artifacts may be present in the images. We propose an anomaly-guided SISR
  process utilizing the denoising mechanism of the diffusion model to iteratively
  remove noise and restore the original image. We train the model to learn the data
  distribution, enabling it to eliminate artifacts within the images. Additionally,
  we ensure reconstruction of the disease regions by prioritizing their reconstruction.
  Our research experiment over the publicly available dataset and find that the existing
  SISR methods are unable to learn and remove these artificially added artifacts.
  On the other hand, our proposed model not only prioritizes superior image reconstruction
  but also remove the artifacts. Our method is found to outperform the existing methods.
  The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Datta-IITJ/MIDL_code.git.
