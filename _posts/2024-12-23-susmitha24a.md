title: Analysis of Transformers for Medical Image Retrieval
abstract: 'This paper investigates the application of transformers to medical image
  retrieval. Although various methods have been attempted in this domain, transformers
  have not been extensively explored. Leveraging vision transformers, we consider
  co-attention between image tokens. Two main aspects are investigated: the analysis
  of various architectures and parameters for transformers and the evaluation of explanation
  techniques. Specifically, we employ contrastive learning to retrieve attention-based
  images that consider the relationships between query and database images. Our experiments
  on diverse medical datasets, such as ISIC 2017, COVID-19 chest X-ray, and Kvasir,
  using multiple transformer architectures, demonstrate superior performance compared
  to convolution-based methods and transformers using cross-entropy losses. Further,
  we conducted a quantitative evaluation of various state-of-the-art explanation techniques
  using insertion-deletion metrics, in addition to basic qualitative assessments.
  Among these methods, Transformer Input Sampling (TIS) stands out, showcasing superior
  performance and enhancing interpretability, thus distinguishing it from black-box
  models.'
