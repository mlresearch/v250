title: Active Learning with the nnUNet and Sample Selection with Uncertainty-Aware
  Submodular Mutual Information Measure
abstract: "Annotating medical images for segmentation tasks is a time-consuming process
  that requiresexpert knowledge. Active learning can reduce this annotation cost and
  achieve optimalmodel performance by selecting only the most informative samples
  for annotation. However, the e\eectiveness of active learning sample selection strategies
  depends on the modelarchitecture and training procedure used. The nnUNet has achieved
  impressive results invarious automated medical image segmentation tasks due to its
  self-configuring pipelinefor automated model design and training. This raises the
  question of whether the nnUNetis applicable in an active learning setting to avoid
  cumbersome manual configuration ofthe training process and improve accessibility
  for non-experts in deep learning-based segmentation. This paper compares various
  sample selection strategies in an active learningsetting in which the self-configuring
  nnUNet is used as the segmentation model. Additionally, we propose a new sample
  selection strategy for UNet-like architectures: USIM - Uncertainty-Aware Submodular
  Mutual Information Measure. The method combinesuncertainty and submodular mutual
  information to select batches of uncertain, diverse,and representative samples.
  We evaluate the performance gain and labeling costs on threemedical image segmentation
  tasks with different segmentation challenges. Our findingsdemonstrate that utilizing
  nnUNet as the segmentation model in an active learning setting is feasible, and
  most sampling strategies outperform random sampling. Furthermore,we demonstrate
  that our proposed method yields a significant improvement compared toexisting baseline
  methods."
