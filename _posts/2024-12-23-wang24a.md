title: Joint Motion Estimation with Geometric Deformation Correction for Fetal Echo
  Planar Images Via Deep Learning
abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end predictive model for efficient
  fetal motion correction using deep neural networks. Diverging from conventional
  methods that estimate fetal brain motions and geometric distortions separately,
  our approach introduces a newly developed joint learning framework that not only
  reliably estimates various degrees of rigid movements, but also effectively corrects
  local geometric distortions of fetal brain images. Specifically, we first develop
  a method to learn rigid motion through a closed-form update integrated into network
  training. Subsequently, we incorporate a diffeomorphic deformation estimation model
  to guide the motion correction network, particularly in regions where local distortions
  and deformations occur. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to
  simultaneously track fetal motion and address geometric deformations in fetal echo-planar
  images. We validated our model using real fetal functional magnetic resonance imaging
  data with simulated and real motions. Our method demonstrates significant practical
  value to measure, track, and correct fetal motion in fetal MRI.
