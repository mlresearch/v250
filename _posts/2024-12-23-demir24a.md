title: Multimodal Image Registration Guided by Few Segmentations from One Modality
abstract: Registration of multimodal images is challenging, especially when dealing
  with different anatomical structures and samples without segmentations. The main
  difficulty arises from the use of registration loss functions that are inadequate
  in the absence of corresponding regions. In this work, we present the first registration
  and segmentation approach tailored to this challenge. In particular, we assume the
  practically highly relevant scenario that only a limited number of segmentations
  are available for one modality and none for the other. First, we augment our few
  segmented samples using unsupervised deep registration within one modality, thereby
  providing many anatomically plausible samples to train a segmentation network. The
  resulting segmentation network then allows us to train a segmentation network on
  the target modality without available segmentations by using an unsupervised domain
  adaptation architecture. Finally, we train a deep registration network to register
  multimodal image pairs purely based on predictions of their segmentation networks.
  Our work demonstrates that using a small number of segmentations from one modality
  enables training a segmentation network on a target modality without the need for
  additional manual segmentations on that modality. Additionally, we show that registration
  based on these segmentations provides smooth and accurate deformation fields on
  anatomically different image pairs, unlike previous methods. We evaluate our approach
  on 2D medical image segmentation and registration between knee DXA and X-ray images.
  Our experiments show that our approach outperforms existing methods. Code is available
