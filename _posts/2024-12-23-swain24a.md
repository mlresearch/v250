title: Nuclei Segmentation in Histopathological Images with  Enhanced U-Net3+
abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of nuclei segmentation, there is an increasing
  trend towards developing a universal segmentation model capable of delivering top-tier
  results across diverse datasets. While achieving this is the ultimate goal, we argue
  that such a model should also outperform dataset-specific specialized models. To
  this end, we propose a task-specific feature sensitive U-Net model, that sets a
  baseline standard in segmentation of nuclei in histopathological images. We meticulously
  select and optimize the underlying U-Net3+ model, using adaptive feature selection
  to capture both short- and long-range dependencies. Max blur pooling is included
  to achieve scale and position invariance, while DropBlock is utilized to mitigate
  overfitting by selectively obscuring feature map regions. Additionally, a Guided
  Filter Block is employed to delineate fine-grained details in nuclei structures.
  Furthermore, we apply various data augmentation techniques, along with stain normalization,
  to reduce inconsistencies and thus resulting in significantly outperforming the
  state-of-the-art performance and paving the way for precise nuclear segmentation
  essential for cancer diagnosis and possible treatment strategies.
