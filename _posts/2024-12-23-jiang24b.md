title: 'Self-supervised pretraining in the wild imparts image acquisition robustness
  to medical image transformers: an application to lung cancer segmentation'
abstract: 'Self-supervised learning (SSL) is an approach to pretrain models with unlabeled
  datasets and extract useful feature representations such that these models can be
  easily fine-tuned for various downstream tasks. \textcolor{blue}{Self-pretraining
  applies SSL on curated task-specific datasets.} Increasing availability of public
  data repositories has now made it possible to utilize diverse and large task unrelated
  datasets to pretrain models in the áº…ild\"{using} SSL. However, the benefit of such
  wild-pretraining over self-pretraining has not been studied in the context of medical
  image analysis. Hence, we analyzed transformers (Swin and ViT) and a convolutional
  neural network created using wild- and self-pretraining trained to segment lung
  tumors from 3D-computed tomography (CT) scans in terms of: (a) accuracy, (b) fine-tuning
  epoch efficiency, and (c) robustness to image acquisition differences (contrast
  versus non-contrast, slice thickness, and image reconstruction kernels). We also
  studied feature reuse using centered kernel alignment (CKA) with the Swin networks.
  Our analysis with two independent testing (public N = 139; internal N = 196) datasets
  showed that wild-pretrained Swin models significantly outperformed self-pretrained
  Swin for the various imaging acquisitions. Fine-tuning epoch efficiency was higher
  for both wild-pretrained Swin and ViT models compared to their self-pretrained counterparts.
  Feature reuse close to the final encoder layers was lower than in the early layers
  for wild-pretrained models irrespective of the pretext tasks used in SSL. Models
  and code will be made available through GitHub upon manuscript acceptance.'
