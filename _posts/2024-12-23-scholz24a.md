title: Imbalance-aware loss functions improve medical image classification
abstract: 'Deep learning models offer unprecedented opportunities for diagnosis, prognosis,
  and treatment planning.    However, conventional deep learning pipelines often encounter
  challenges in learning unbiased classifiers within imbalanced data settings, frequently
  exhibiting bias towards minority classes.    In this study, we aim to improve medical
  image classification by effectively addressing class imbalance.    To this end,
  we employ differentiable loss functions derived from classification metrics commonly
  used in imbalanced data settings: Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and the
  F1 score.    We explore the efficacy of these loss functions both independently
  and in combination with cross-entropy loss and various batch sampling strategies
  on diverse medical datasets of 2D fundoscopy and 3D magnetic resonance images.    Our
  findings demonstrate that, compared to conventional loss functions, we achieve notable
  improvements in overall classification performance, with increases of up to +12%
  in balanced accuracy and up to +51% in class-wise F1 score for minority classes
  when utilizing cross-entropy coupled with metrics-derived loss. Additionally, we
  conduct feature visualization to gain insights into the behavior of these features
  during training with imbalance-aware loss functions. Our visualization reveals a
  more pronounced clustering of minority classes in the feature space, consistent
  with our classification results.    Our results underscore the effectiveness of
  combining cross-entropy loss with class-imbalance-aware loss functions in training
  more accurate classifiers, particularly for minority classes.'
