title: Automated ranking of chest x-ray radiological finding severity in a binary
  label setting
abstract: 'Machine learning has demonstrated the ability to match or exceed human
  performance in detecting a range of abnormalities in chest x-rays. However, current
  models largely operate within a binary classification paradigm with findings either
  present or absent using fixed decision thresholds, whereas many clinical findings
  can be more usefully described on a scale of severity which a skilled radiologist
  will incorporate into a more nuanced report. This limitation is due, in part, to
  the difficulty and expense of manually annotating fine-grained labels for training
  and test images versus the relative ease of automatically extracting binary labels
  from the associated free text reports using NLP algorithms. In this paper we examine
  the ability of models trained with only binary training data to give useful abnormality
  severity information from their raw outputs. We assess performance on a ranking
  task using manually ranked test sets for each of five findings: cardiomegaly, consolidation,
  paratracheal hilar changes, pleural effusion and subcutaneous emphysema. We find
  the raw model output agrees with human-assessed severity ranking with Spearman≈õ
  rank coefficients between 0.563 - 0.848. Using patient age as an additional radiological
  finding with full ground truth ranking available, we go on to compare a binary classifier
  output against a fully supervised RankNet model, quantifying the reduction in training
  data required in the fully supervised setting for equivalent performance. We show
  that model performance is improved using a semi-supervised approach supplementing
  a smaller set of fully supervised images with a larger set of binary labelled images.'
