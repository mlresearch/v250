title: 'Ano-swinMAE: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Brain MRI using swin Transformer
  based Masked Auto Encoder'
abstract: 'The advanced deep learning-based Autoencoding techniques have enabled the
  introduction of efficient Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) approaches. Several
  autoencoder-based approaches have been used to solve UAD tasks. However, most of
  these approaches do not have any constraints to ensure the removal of pathological
  features while restoring the healthy regions in the pseudo-healthy image reconstruction.
  To remove the occurrence of pathological features, we propose to utilize an Autoencoder
  which deploys a masking strategy to reconstruct images. Additionally, the masked
  regions need to be meaningfully inpainted to enforce global and local consistency
  in the generated images which makes transformer-based masked autoencoder a potential
  approach. Although the transformer models can incorporate global contextual information,
  they are often computationally expensive and dependent on a large amount of data
  for training. Hence we propose to employ a Swin transformer-based Masked Autoencoder
  (MAE) for anomaly detection (Ano-swinMAE) in brain MRI. Our proposed method Ano-swinMAE
  is trained on a  healthy cohort by masking a certain percentage of information from
  the input images. While inferring, a pathological image is given to the model and
  different segments of the brain MRI slice are sequentially masked and their corresponding
  generation is accumulated to create a map indicating potential locations of pathologies.
  We have quantitatively and qualitatively validated the performance increment of
  our method on the following publicly available datasets: BraTS (Glioma), MSLUB (Multiple
  Sclerosis) and White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH). We have also empirically evaluated
  the generalisation capability of the method in a cross modality data setup.'
