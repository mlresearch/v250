title: Multi-scale Stochastic Generation of Labelled Microscopy Images for Neuron
  Segmentation
abstract: We introduce a novel method leveraging conditional generative adversarial
  networks (cGANs) to generate diverse, high-resolution microscopy images for neuron
  tracing model training. This approach addresses the challenge of limited annotated
  data availability, a significant obstacle in automating neuron dendrite tracing.
  Our technique utilizes a multi-scale cascade process to generate synthetic images
  from single neuron tractograms, accurately replicating the complex characteristics
  of real microscopy images, encompassing imaging artifacts and background structures.
  In experiments, our method generates diverse images that mimic the characteristics
  of two distinct neuron microscopy datasets, which were successfully used as training
  data in the segmentation task of real neuron images.
