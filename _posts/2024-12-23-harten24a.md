title: 'REINDIR: Repeated Embedding Infusion for Neural Deformable Image Registration'
abstract: 'The use of implicit neural representations (INRs) has been explored for
  medical image registration in a number of recent works. Using these representations
  has several advantages over both classic optimization-based methods and deep learning-based
  methods, but it is hindered by long optimization times during inference. To address
  this issue, we propose REINDIR: Repeated Embedding Infusion for Neural Deformable
  Image Registration. REINDIR is a meta-learning framework that uses a combination
  of an image encoder and template representations, which are infused with image embeddings
  to specialize them for a pair of test images. This specialization results in a better
  initialization for the subsequent optimization process. By broadcasting the encodings
  to fill our modulation weight matrices, we greatly reduce the required size of the
  encoder compared to approaches that predict the complete weight matrices directly.
  Additionally, our method retains the flexibility to infuse arbitrarily large encodings.
  The presented approach greatly improves the efficiency of deformable registration
  with INRs when applied to (near-)IID data, while remaining robust to severe domain
  shifts from the distribution the method is trained on.'
