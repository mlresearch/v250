title: 'Towards a Collective Medical Imaging AI: Enabling Continual Learning from
  Peers'
abstract: Federated learning is an exciting area within machine learning that allows
  cross-silo training of large-scale machine learning models on disparate or similar
  tasks in a privacy-preserving manner. However, conventional federated learning frameworks
  require a synchronous training schedule and are incapable of lifelong learning.
  To that end, we propose an asynchronous decentralized federated lifelong learning
  (ADFLL) method that allows agents in the system to asynchronously and continually
  learn from their own previous experiences and others\â€™, thus overcoming the potential
  drawbacks of conventional federated learning. We evaluate the ADFLL framework in
  two experimental setups for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based landmark localization
  across different imaging modalities, orientations, and sequences. The ADFLL was
  compared to central aggregation and conventional lifelong learning for upper-bound
  comparison and with a conventional DRL model for lower-bound comparison. Across
  all the experiments, ADFLL demonstrated excellent capability to collaboratively
  learn all tasks across all the agents compared to the baseline models in in-distribution
  and out-of-distribution test sets. In conclusion, we provide a flexible, efficient,
  and robust federated lifelong learning framework that can be deployed in real-world
  applications.
