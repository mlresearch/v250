title: 'An unexpected confounder: how brain shape can be used to classify MRI scans
  ?'
abstract: Although deep learning has proved its effectiveness in the analysis of medical
  images, its great ability to extract complex features makes it susceptible to base
  its decision on spurious confounders present in the images. However, especially
  for medical applications, network decisions must be based on relevant elements.
  Numerous confounding factors have been identified in the case of brain scans such
  as gender, age, MRI sites or scanners, etc. Nevertheless, although skull stripping
  is a classic preprocessing step for brain scans, brain shape has never been considered
  as a possible confounder. In this work, we show that brain shape is used in the
  classification of brain MRI scans from different databases, even when it should
  not be considered as a clinically relevant factor. To this purpose, we introduce
  a rigorous two steps method to assess whether a factor is a confounder or not, and
  we apply it to identify the brain shape as a confounding variable in brain images
  classification. Lastly, we propose to use a deformable registration in the data
  preprocessing pipeline to align the brain contours of the images in the datasets,
  whereas standard pipelines often do nothing more than affine registration. Including
  this deformable registration step makes the classification free from the brain shape
  confounding effect.
