title: Target and task specific source-free domain adaptive image segmentation
abstract: 'Solving the domain shift problem during inference is essential in medical
  imaging as most deep-learning based solutions suffer from it. In practice, domain
  shifts are tackled by performing Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), where a model
  is adapted to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging the labelled source domain.
  In medical scenarios, the data comes with huge privacy concerns making it difficult
  to apply standard UDA techniques. Hence, a closer clinical setting is Source-Free
  UDA (SFUDA), where we have access to source trained model but not the source data
  during adaptation. Methods trying to solve SFUDA typically address the domain shift
  using pseudo-label based self-training techniques. However due to domain shift,
  these pseudo-labels are usually of high entropy and denoising them still does not
  make them perfect labels to supervise the model. Therefore, adapting the source
  model with noisy pseudo labels reduces its segmentation capability while addressing
  the domain shift. To this end, we propose a two-stage approach for source-free domain
  adaptive image segmentation: 1) Target-specific adaptation followed by 2) Task-specific
  adaptation. In the Stage-I, we focus on learning target-specific representation
  and generating high-quality pseudo labels by leveraging a proposed ensemble entropy
  minimization loss and selective voting strategy. In Stage II, we focus on improving
  segmentation performance by utilizing teacher-student self-training and augmentation-guided
  consistency loss, leveraging the pseudo labels obtained from Stage I. We evaluate
  our proposed method on both 2D fundus datasets and 3D MRI volumes across 7 different
  domain shifts where we achieve better performance than recent UDA and SF-UDA methods
  for medical image segmentation. Code is available at https://github.com/Vibashan/tt-sfuda.'
