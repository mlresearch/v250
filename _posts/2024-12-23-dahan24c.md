title: Video Polyp Segmentation using Implicit Networks
abstract: Polyp segmentation in endoscopic videos is an essential task in medical
  image and video analysis, requiring pixel-level accuracy to accurately identify
  and localize polyps within the video sequences. Addressing this task unveils the
  intricate interplay of dynamic changes in the video and the complexities involved
  in tracking polyps across frames. Our research presents an innovative approach to
  effectively meet these challenges that integrates, at test time, a pre-trained image
  (2D) model with a new form of implicit representation. By leveraging the temporal
  understanding provided by implicit networks and enhancing it with optical flow-based
  temporal losses, we significantly enhance the precision and consistency of polyp
  segmentation across sequential frames. Our proposed framework demonstrates excellent
  performance across various medical benchmarks and datasets, setting a new standard
  in video polyp segmentation with high spatial and temporal consistency. Our code
  is publicly available at https://github.com/AviadDahan/VPS-implicit.
