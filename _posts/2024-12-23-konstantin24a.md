title: 'ASMR: Angular Support for Malfunctioning Client Resilience in Federated Learning'
abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows the training of deep neural networks in a
  distributed andprivacy-preserving manner. However, this concept suffers from malfunctioning
  updatessent by the attending clients that cause global model performance degradation.
  Reasonsfor this malfunctioning might be technical issues, disadvantageous training
  data, or mali-cious attacks. Most of the current defense mechanisms are meant to
  require impracticalprerequisites like knowledge about the number of malfunctioning
  updates, which makesthem unsuitable for real-world applications. To counteract these
  problems, we introducea novel method called ASMR, that dynamically excludes malfunctioning
  clients based ontheir angular distance. Our novel method does not require any hyperparameters
  or knowl-edge about the number of malfunctioning clients. Our experiments showcase
  the detectioncapabilities of ASMR in an image classification task on a histopathological
  dataset, whilealso presenting findings on the significance of dynamically adapting
  decision boundaries.
