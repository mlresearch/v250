title: 'DeCoDEx: Confounder Detector Guidance for Improved Diffusion-based Counterfactual
  Explanations'
abstract: Deep learning classifiers are prone to latching onto dominant confounders
  present in a dataset rather than on the causal markers associated with the target
  class, leading to poor generalization and biased predictions. Although explainability
  via counterfactual image generation has been successful at exposing the problem,
  bias mitigation strategies that permit accurate explainability in the presence of
  dominant and diverse artifacts remain unsolved. In this work, we propose the DeCoDEx
  framework and show how an external, pre-trained binary artifact detector can be
  leveraged during inference to guide a diffusion-based counterfactual image generator
  towards accurate explainability.  Experiments on the CheXpert dataset, using both
  synthetic artifacts and real visual artifacts (support devices), show that the proposed
  method successfully synthesizes the counterfactual images that change the causal
  pathology markers associated with Pleural Effusion while preserving or ignoring
  the visual artifacts. Augmentation of ERM and Group-DRO classifiers with the DeCoDEx
  generated images substantially improves the results across underrepresented groups
  that are out of distribution for each class. The code is made publicly available
