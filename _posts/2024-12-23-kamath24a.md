title: Comparing the Performance of Radiation Oncologists versus a Deep Learning Dose
  Predictor to Estimate Dosimetric Impact of Segmentation Variations for Radiotherapy
abstract: Current evaluation methods for quality control of manual/automated tumor
  and organs-at- risk segmentation for radiotherapy are driven mostly by geometric
  correctness. It is however known that geometry-driven segmentation quality metrics
  cannot characterize potentially detrimental dosimetric effects of sub-optimal tumor
  segmentation. In this work, we build on prior studies proposing deep learning-based
  dose prediction models to extend its use for the task of contour quality evaluation
  of brain tumor treatment planning. Using a test set of 54 contour variants and their
  corresponding dose plans, we show that our model can be used to dosimetrically assess
  the quality of contours and can outperform clinical expert radiation oncologists
  while estimating sub-optimal situations. We compare results against three such experts
  and demonstrate improved accuracy in addition to time savings. Our code is available
