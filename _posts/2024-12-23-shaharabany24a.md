title: Zero-Shot Medical Image Segmentation Based on Sparse Prompt Using Finetuned
  SAM
abstract: Segmentation of medical images plays a critical role in various clinical
  applications, facilitat- ing precise diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease
  monitoring. However, the scarcity of annotated data poses a significant challenge
  for training deep learning models in the medical imaging domain. In this paper,
  we propose a novel approach for minimally-guided zero-shot segmentation of medical
  images using the Segment Anything Model (SAM), orig- inally trained on natural images.
  The method leverages SAMâ€™s ability to segment arbitrary objects in natural scenes
  and adapts it to the medical domain without the need for labeled medical data, except
  for a few foreground and background points on the test image it- self. To this end,
  we introduce a two-stage process, involving the extraction of an initial mask from
  self-similarity maps and test-time fine-tuning of SAM. We run experiments on diverse
  medical imaging datasets, including AMOS22, MoNuSeg and the Gland segmen- tation
  (GlaS) challenge, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
