title: 'Med-Tuning: A New Parameter-Efficient Tuning Framework for Medical Volumetric
  Segmentation'
abstract: The p̈re-training then fine-tuning (FT)\"{paradigm} is widely adopted to
  boost the model performance of deep learning-based methods for medical volumetric
  segmentation. However, conventional full FT incurs high computational and memory
  costs. Thus, it is of increasing importance to fine-tune pre-trained models for
  medical volumetric segmentation tasks in a both effective and parameter-efficient
  manner. In this paper, we introduce a new framework named Med-Tuning to realize
  parameter-efficient tuning (PET) for medical volumetric segmentation task and an
  efficient plug-and-play module named Med-Adapter for task-specific feature extraction.
  With a small number of tuned parameters, our framework enhances the 2D baselinesś
  precision on segmentation tasks, which are pre-trained on natural images. Extensive
  experiments on three benchmark datasets (CT and MRI modalities) show that our method
  achieves better results than previous PET methods on volumetric segmentation tasks.
  Compared to full FT, Med-Tuning reduces the fine-tuned model parameters by up to
  4x, with even better segmentation performance. Our project webpage is at \url{https://rubics-xuan.github.io/Med-Tuning/}.
