title: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Supervised and Self-supervised Pre-training on
  Multi-view Chest X-ray Classification
abstract: Chest X-ray analysis in medical imaging has largely focused on single-view
  methods. However, recent advancements have led to the development of multi-view
  approaches that harness the potential of multiple views for the same patient. Although
  these methods have shown improvements, it is especially difficult to collect large
  multi-view labeled datasets owing to the prohibitive annotation costs and acquisition
  times. Hence, it is crucial to address the multi-view setting in the low data regime.
  Pre-training is a critical component to ensure efficient performance in this low
  data regime, as evidenced by its improvements in natural and medical imaging. However,
  in the multi-view setup, such pre-training strategies have received relatively little
  attention and ImageNet initialization remains largely the norm. We bridge this research
  gap by conducting an extensive benchmarking study illustrating the efficacy of 10
  strong supervised and self-supervised models pre-trained on both natural and medical
  images for multi-view chest X-ray classification. We further examine the performance
  in the low data regime by training these methods on 1%, 10%, and 100% fractions
  of the training set. Moreover, our best models yield significant improvements compared
  to existing state-of-the-art multi-view approaches, outperforming them by as much
  as 9.9%, 8.8% and 1.6% on the 1%, 10%, and 100% data fractions respectively. We
  hope this benchmark will spur the development of stronger multi-view medical imaging
  models, similar to the role of such benchmarks in other computer vision and medical
  imaging domains. As open science, we make our code publicly available to aid in
  the development of stronger multi-view models.
