title: 'FluidRegNet: Longitudinal registration of retinal OCT images with new pathological
  fluids'
abstract: Eye diseases such as the chronic central serous chorioretinopathy are characterized
  by fluid deposits that alter the retina and impair vision. These fluids occur at
  irregular intervals and may dissolve spontaneously or thanks to treatment. Accurately
  capturing this behavior within an image registration framework is challenging due
  to the resulting prominent tissue deformations and missing image correspondences
  between visits. This paper presents FluidRegNet, a convolutional neural network
  for the registration of successive optical coherence tomography images of the retina.
  The correspondence between time points is established by predicting the position
  of the origin of the fluids by creating a fluid seed in the form of sparse intensity
  offsets in the moving image and registering the fluid seed to the affected area
  in the follow-up image. We show that this leads to deformation fields that more
  accurately reflect the actual dynamics of retinal fluid growth compared to other
  image registration methods. In addition, the network outputs are used for unsupervised
  fluid segmentation.
