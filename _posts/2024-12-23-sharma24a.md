title: Lupus Nephritis Subtype Classification with only Slide Level Labels
abstract: Lupus Nephritis classification has historically relied on labor-intensive
  and meticulous glomerular-level labeling of renal structures in whole slide images
  (WSIs). However, this approach presents a formidable challenge due to its tedious
  and resource-intensive nature, limiting its scalability and practicality in clinical
  settings. In response to this challenge, our work introduces a novel methodology
  that utilizes only slide-level labels, eliminating the need for granular glomerular-level
  labeling. A comprehensive multi-stained lupus nephritis digital histopathology WSI
  dataset was created from the Indian population, which is the largest of its kind.
  LupusNet, a deep learning MIL-based model, was developed for the sub- type classification
  of LN. The results underscore its effectiveness, achieving an AUC score of 91.0%,
  an F1-score of 77.3%, and an accuracy of 81.1% on our dataset in distinguishing
  membranous and diffused classes of LN.
