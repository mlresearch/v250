title: 'ADAPT: Multimodal Learning for Detecting Physiological Changes under Missing
  Modalities'
abstract: 'Multimodality has recently gained attention in the medical domain, where
  imaging or video modalities may be integrated with biomedical signals or health
  records. Yet, two challenges remain: balancing the contributions of modalities,
  especially in cases with a limited amount of data available, and tackling missing
  modalities. To address both issues, in this paper, we introduce the AnchoreD multimodAl
  Physiological Transformer (ADAPT), a multimodal, scalable framework with two key
  components: (i) aligning all modalities in the space of the strongest, richest modality
  (called anchor) to learn a joint embedding space, and (ii) a Masked Multimodal Transformer,
  leveraging both inter- and intra-modality correlations while handling missing modalities.
  We focus on detecting physiological changes in two real-life scenarios: stress in
  individuals induced by specific triggers and fighter pilots\â€™{loss} of consciousness
  induced by g-forces. We validate the generalizability of ADAPT through extensive
  experiments on two datasets for these tasks, where we set the new state of the art
  while demonstrating its robustness across various modality scenarios and its high
  potential for real-life applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/jumdc/ADAPT.git.'
