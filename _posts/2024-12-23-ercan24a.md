title: 'Predicting DNA Content Abnormalities in Barrett’s Esophagus: A Weakly Supervised
  Learning Paradigm'
abstract: Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is the sole precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma
  (EAC), and is an opportunity for developing biomarkers for cancer risk assessment.
  DNA content abnormalities, including aneuploidy, have been implicated in the progression
  to EAC in BE patients, but molecular assays require valuable tissue for its detection.
  We propose utilizing images from routine histology to detect ploidy status using
  deep learning.Employing a weakly supervised deep learning approach, multi-instance
  learning (MIL), we trained a model to predict ploidy using hematoxylin and eosin-stained
  whole slide images of endoscopic biopsies and flow cytometry results. The study
  introduces a novel data augmentation method for MIL, sequentially altering features
  from original and augmented images during training loops. This method improved the
  average area under curve (AUC) from 0.43, 0.64 and 0.81 for ResNet50, DenseNet121
  and REMEDIS foundation model, respectively (training without any augmentation),
  to 0.61, 0.87 and 0.91 with the proposed augmentation strategy.The top-performing
  model, using REMEDIS foundation model as the backbone, achieved 0.93 AUC and 0.83
  balanced accuracy to predict aneuploidy in the test cohort biopsies (n=279). Across
  all the patients (n=123), predicted aneuploidy status was correlated with progression
  to EAC (p=6.55e-06), similar to correlation with ploidy status based on flow cytometry
  results (p=2.84e-7). Supporting the findings, histologic nuclear features typically
  associated with dysplasia and DNA content abnormalities such as enlarged, hyperchromatic
  nuclei and loss of nuclear polarity, were seen in the samples called abnormal compared
  to the control diploid samples.In conclusion, our deep learning model efficiently
  predicts aneuploidy, a mechanism that has been shown to underpin BE progression
  to EAC. This method, preserving precious biopsy tissues, complements routine histology,
  offering potential for identifying individuals at high risk of progression through
  molecular-based advancements.
