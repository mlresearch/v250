title: Generating Cerebral Vessel Trees of Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients using Conditional
  Set-Diffusion
abstract: The advancements in computational modeling and simulations have facilitated
  the emergence of in-silico clinical trials (ISCTs). ISCTs are valuable in developing
  and evaluating novel treatments targeting acute ischemic stroke (AIS), a prominent
  contributor to both mortality and disability rates. However, obtaining large populations
  of accurate anatomical structures that are required as input to ISCTs is labor-intensive
  and time-consuming. In this work, we propose and evaluate diffusion-based generative
  modeling and set transformers to generate a population of synthetic intracranial
  vessel tree centerlines with associated radii and vessel types. We condition our
  model on the presence of an occlusion in the middle cerebral artery, a frequently
  occurring occlusion location in AIS patients. Our analysis of generated synthetic
  populations shows that our model accurately produces diverse and realistic cerebral
  vessel trees that represent the geometric characteristics of the real population.
