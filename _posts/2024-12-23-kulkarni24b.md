title: Registration Quality Evaluation Metric with Self-Supervised Siamese Networks
abstract: 'Registration is one of the most preliminary steps in many medical imaging
  downstream tasks. The registration quality determines the quality of the downstream
  task. Traditionally, registration quality evaluation is performed with pixel-wise
  metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). These
  pixel-wise measures are sometimes susceptible to local minima, providing sub-optimal
  and inconsistent quality evaluation. Moreover, it might be essential to incorporate
  semantic features crucial for human visual perception of the registration quality.
  Towards this end, we propose a data-driven approach to learn the semantic similarity
  between the registered and target images to ensure a perceptual and consistent evaluation
  of the registration quality. In this work, we train a Siamese network to classify
  registered and synthetically misaligned pairs of images. We leverage the latent
  Siamese encodings to formulate a semantic registration evaluation metric, SiamRegQC.
  We analyze SiamRegQC from different perspectives: robustness to local minima or
  smoothness of evaluation metric, sensitivity to smaller misalignment errors, consistency
  with visual inspection, and statistically significant evaluation of registration
  algorithms with a p-value $<$ 0.05. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SiamRegQC
  on two downstream tasks; (i) Rigid registration of 2D histological serial sections,
  where evaluating sub-pixel misalignment errors is critical for accurate 3D volume
  reconstruction. SiamRegQC provides a more realistic quality evaluation sensitive
  to smaller errors and consistent with visual inspection illustrated with more perceptual
  semantic feature maps rather than pixel-wise MSE maps. (ii) Unsupervised multimodal
  non-rigid registration, where the registration framework trained with SiamRegQC
  as a loss function exhibits a maximum average SSIM value of 0.825 over previously
  proposed deep similarity metrics.'
