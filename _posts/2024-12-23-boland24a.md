title: 'There Are No Shortcuts to Anywhere Worth Going: Identifying Shortcuts in Deep
  Learning Models for Medical Image Analysis'
abstract: Many studies have reported human-level accuracy (or better) for AI-powered
  algorithms performing a specific clinical task, such as detecting pathology. However,
  these results often fail to generalize to other scanners or populations. Several
  mechanisms have been identified that confound generalization. One such is shortcut
  learning, where a network erroneously learns to depend on a fragile spurious feature,
  such as a text label added to the image, rather than scrutinizing the genuinely
  useful regions of the image. In this way, systems can exhibit misleadingly high
  test-set results while the labels are present but fail badly elsewhere where the
  relationship between the label and the spurious feature breaks down. In this paper,
  we investigate whether it is possible to detect shortcut learning and locate where
  the shortcut is happening in a neural network. We propose a novel methodology utilizing
  the sample difficulty metric Prediction Depth (PD) and KL divergence to identify
  specific layers of a neural network model where the learned features of a shortcut
  manifest. We demonstrate that our approach can effectively isolate these layers
  across several shortcuts, model architectures, and datasets. Using this, we show
  a correlation between the visual complexity of a shortcut, the depth of its feature
  manifestation within the model, and the extent to which a model relies on it. Finally,
  we highlight the nuanced relationship between learning rate and shortcut learning.
