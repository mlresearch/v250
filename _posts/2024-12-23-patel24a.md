title: Resolution and Field of View Invariant Generative Modelling with Latent Diffusion
  Models
abstract: Large dataset requirements for deep learning methods can pose a challenge
  in the medical field, where datasets tend to be relatively small. Synthetic data
  can provide a suitable solution to this problem, when complemented with real data.
  However current generative methods normally require all data to be of the same resolution
  and, ideally, aligned to an atlas. This not only creates more stringent restrictions
  on the training data but also limits what data can be used for inference. To overcome
  this our work proposes a latent diffusion model that is able to control sample geometries
  by varying their resolution, field of view, and orientation. We demonstrate this
  work on whole body CT data, using a spatial conditioning mechanism. We showcase
  how our model provides samples as good as an ordinary latent diffusion model trained
  fully on whole body single resolution data. This is in addition to the benefit of
  further control over resolution, field of view, orientation, and even the emergent
  behaviour of super-resolution. We found that our model could create realistic images
  across the varying tasks showcasing the potential of this application.
