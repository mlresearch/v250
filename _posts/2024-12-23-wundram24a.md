title: 'Leveraging Probabilistic Segmentation Models for Improved Glaucoma Diagnosis:
  A Clinical Pipeline Approach'
abstract: The accurate segmentation of the optic cup and disc in fundus images is
  essential for diagnostic processes such as glaucoma detection. The inherent ambiguity
  in locating these structures often poses a significant challenge, leading to potential
  misdiagnosis. To model such ambiguities, numerous probabilistic segmentation models
  have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the integration of these probabilistic
  segmentation models into a multistage pipeline closely resembling clinical practice.
  Our findings indicate that leveraging the uncertainties provided by these models
  substantially enhances the quality of glaucoma diagnosis compared to relying on
  a single segmentation only.
