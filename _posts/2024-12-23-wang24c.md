title: 'Skin Malignancy Classification Using Patients’ Skin Images and Meta-data:
  Multimodal Fusion for Improving Fairness'
abstract: Skin cancer image classification across skin tones is a challenging problem
  due to the fact that skin cancer can present differently on different skin tones.
  This study evaluates the performance of image only models and fusion models in skin
  malignancy classification. The fusion models we consider are able to take in additional
  patient data, such as an indicator of their skin tone, and merge this information
  with the features provided by the image-only model. Results from the experiment
  show that fusion models perform substantially better than image-only models. In
  particular, we find that a form of multiplicative fusion results in the best performing
  models. This finding suggests that skin tones add predictive value in skin malignancy
  prediction problems. We further demonstrate that feature fusion methods reduce,
  but do not entirely eliminate, the disparity in performance of the model on patients
  with different skin tones.
