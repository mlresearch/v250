title: Finite Volume Informed Graph Neural Network for Myocardial Perfusion Simulation
abstract: Medical imaging and numerical simulation of partial differential equations
  (PDEs) representing biophysical processes, have been combined in the past few decades
  to provide noninvasive diagnostic and treatment prediction tools for various diseases.
  Most approaches involve solving computationally expensive PDEs, which can hinder
  their effective deployment in clinical settings. To overcome this limitation, deep
  learning has emerged as a promising method to accelerate numerical solvers. One
  challenge persists however in the generalization abilities of these models, given
  the wide variety of patient morphologies. This study addresses this challenge by
  introducing a physics-informed graph neural network designed to solve Darcy equations
  for the simulation of myocardial perfusion. Leveraging a finite volume discretization
  of the equations as a p̈hysics-informed\"{loss}, our model was successfully trained
  and tested on a 3D synthetic dataset, namely meshes representing simplified myocardium
  shapes. Subsequent evaluation on a genuine myocardium mesh, extracted from patient
  Computed Tomography images, demonstrated promising results and generalized capabilities.
  Such a fast solver, within a differentiable learning framework will enable to tackle
  inverse problems based on $\text{H}_2$O-PET perfusion imaging data.
