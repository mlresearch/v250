title: Combining Reconstruction-based Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Supervised
  Segmentation for Brain MRIs
abstract: In contrast to supervised deep learning approaches, unsupervised anomaly
  detection (UAD) methods can be trained with healthy data only and do not require
  pixel-level annotations, enabling the identification of unseen pathologies. While
  this is promising for clinical screening tasks, reconstruction-based UAD methods
  fall short in segmentation accuracy compared to supervised models. Therefore, self-supervised
  UAD approaches have been proposed to improve segmentation accuracy. Typically, synthetic
  anomalies are used to train a segmentation network in a supervised fashion. However,
  this approach does not effectively generalize to real pathologies. We propose a
  framework combining reconstruction-based and self-supervised UAD methods to improve
  both segmentation performance for known anomalies and generalization to unknown
  pathologies. The framework includes an unsupervised diffusion model trained on healthy
  data to produce pseudo-healthy reconstructions and a supervised Unet trained to
  delineate anomalies from deviations between input- reconstruction pairs. Besides
  the effective use of synthetic training data, this framework allows for weakly-supervised
  training with small annotated data sets, generalizing to unseen pathologies. Our
  results show that with our approach, utilizing annotated data sets during training
  can substantially improve the segmentation performance for in-domain data while
  maintaining the generalizability of reconstruction-based approaches to pathologies
  unseen during training.
