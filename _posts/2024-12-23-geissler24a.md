title: Structure Size as Confounder in Uncertainty Based Segmentation Quality Prediction
abstract: Various uncertainty estimation methods have been proposed for deep learning-based
  image segmentation models. An uncertainty measure is treated useful if it can be
  used to accurately predict segmentation quality. Therefore, structure-wise uncertainty
  measures are frequently correlated with measures like the Dice score. However, it
  is known that the Dice score highly depends on the size of the structure of interest.
  It is less well-known that popular structure-wise uncertainty measures also correlate
  with structure size. Therefore, the structure size acts as confounding variable
  when trying to quantify the performance of such uncertainty measures via correlation.
  We investigate this for the popular uncertainty measures structure-wise epistemic
  uncertainty, mean pairwise Dice and volume variation coefficient based on test-time-augmentation,
  Monte Carlo Dropout and model ensembles. We propose to use a partial correlation
  coefficient to address structure size as confounding variable and arrive at lower
  correlation estimates which better reflect the true relationship between segmentation
  quality and structure-wise uncertainty.
