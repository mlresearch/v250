title: 'ThickV-Stain: Unprocessed Thick Tissues Virtual Staining for Rapid Intraoperative
  Histology'
abstract: Virtual staining has shown great promise in realizing a rapid and low-cost
  clinical alternative for pathological examinations, eliminating the need for chemical
  reagents and laborious staining procedures. However, most of the previous studies
  mainly focus on thin slice samples, which still require tissue sectioning and are
  unsuitable for intraoperative use. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale model
  to virtually stain label-free and slide-free biological tissues, allowing hematoxylin-
  and eosin- (H&E) staining generation in less than a minute for an image with 100
  million pixels. We name this ThickV-Stain model, specifically developed to virtually
  stain intricated and unprocessed thick tissues. We harness the ability of a multi-scale
  network to encourage the model to capture multiple-level micromorphological characteristics
  from low-resolution images. Experimental results highlight the advantages of our
  multi-scale method for virtual staining on unprocessed thick samples. We also show
  the effectiveness of ThickV-Stain on thin sections, showing generalizability to
  other clinical workflows. The proposed method enables us to obtain virtually stained
  images from unstained samples within minutes and can be seamlessly integrated with
  downstream pathological analysis tasks, providing an efficient alternative scheme
  for intraoperative assessment as well as general pathological examination.
