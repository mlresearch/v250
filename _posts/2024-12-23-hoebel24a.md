title: 'Beyond Structured Attributes: Image-Based Predictive Trends for Chest X-Ray
  Classification'
abstract: A commonly emphasized challenge in medical AI is the drop in performance
  when testing on data from institutions other than those used for training. However,
  even if models trained on distinct datasets perform similarly well overall, they
  may still exhibit other systematic differences. Here, we study these potential dataset-centric
  prediction variations using two popular chest x-ray datasets, CheXpert (CXP) and
  MIMIC-CXR (MMC). While CXP-trained models generally perform better on CXP than MMC
  test data and vice versa, this performance decrease is not uniform across individual
  images. We find that image-level variations in predictions are not random but can
  be inferred well above chance, even for pathologies where the overall performance
  gap is small, suggesting that there are systematic tendencies of models trained
  on different datasets. Furthermore, these pÌˆredictive tendencies\"{are} not solely
  explained by image statistics or attributes like radiographic position or patient
  sex, but rather are pathology-specific and related to higher-order image characteristics.
  Our findings stress the complexity of AI robustness and generalization, highlighting
  the need for a nuanced approach that especially considers the diversity of pathology
  presentation.
