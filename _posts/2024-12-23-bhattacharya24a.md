title: 'GazeDiff: A radiologist visual attention guided diffusion model for zero-shot
  disease classification'
abstract: We present GazeDiff, a novel architecture that leverages radiologists\â€™{eye}
  gaze patterns as controls to text-to-image diffusion models for zero-shot classification.
  Eye-gaze patterns provide important cues during the visual exploration process;
  existing diffusion-based models do not harness the valuable insights derived from
  these patterns during image interpretation. GazeDiff utilizes a novel expert visual
  attention-conditioned diffusion model to generate robust medical images. This model
  offers more than just image generation capabilities; the density estimates derived
  from the gaze-guided diffusion model can effectively improve zero-shot classification
  performance. We show the zero-shot classification efficacy of GazeDiff on four publicly
  available datasets for two common pulmonary disease types, namely pneumonia, and
  tuberculosis.
