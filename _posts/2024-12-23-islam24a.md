title: Uncertainty-aware retinal layer segmentation in OCT through probabilistic signed
  distance functions
abstract: In this paper, we present a new approach for uncertainty-aware retinal layer
  segmentation in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans using probabilistic signed
  distance functions (SDF). Traditional pixel-wise and regression-based methods primarily
  encounter difficulties in precise segmentation and lack of geometrical grounding
  respectively. To address these shortcomings, our methodology refines the segmentation
  by predicting a signed distance function (SDF) that effectively parameterizes the
  retinal layer shape via level set. We further enhance the framework by integrating
  probabilistic modeling, applying Gaussian distributions to encapsulate the uncertainty
  in the shape parameterization. This ensures a robust representation of the retinal
  layer morphology even in the presence of ambiguous input, imaging noise, and unreliable
  segmentations. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate superior
  performance when compared to other methods. Additionally, we conducted experiments
  on artificially distorted datasets with various noise types—shadowing, blinking,
  speckle, and motion—common in OCT scans to showcase the effectiveness of our uncertainty
  estimation. Our findings demonstrate the possibility of obtaining reliable segmentation
  of retinal layers, as well as an initial step towards the characterization of layer
  integrity, a key biomarker for disease progression. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/niazoys/RLS_PSDF}.
