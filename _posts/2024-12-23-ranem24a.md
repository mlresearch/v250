title: 'UnCLe SAM: Unleashing SAM’s Potential for Continual Prostate MRI Segmentation'
abstract: Continual medical image segmentation primarily explores the utilization
  of U-Net and its derivatives within the realm of medical imaging, posing significant
  challenges in meeting the demands of shifting domains over time. Foundation models
  serve as robust knowledge repositories, offering unique advantages such as general
  applicability, knowledge transferability, and continuous improvements. By leveraging
  pre-existing domain insights, adaptability, generalization, and performance across
  diverse tasks can be enhanced.In this work, we show how to deploy Segment Anything
  Modelś (SAM) natural image pretraining for the continual medical image segmentation,
  where data is sparse.We introduce UnCLe SAM, a novel approach that uses the knowledge
  of the pre-trained SAM foundation model to make it suitable for continual segmentation
  in dynamic environments.We demonstrate that UnCLe SAM is a robust alternative to
  U-Net-based approaches and showcase its state-of-the-art (SOTA) continual medical
  segmentation capabilities.The primary objective of UnCLe SAM is to strike a delicate
  balance between model rigidity and plasticity, effectively addressing prevalent
  pitfalls within CL methodologies.We assess UnCLe SAM through a series of prostate
  segmentation tasks, applying a set of different CL methods. Comparative evaluations
  against the SOTA Lifelong nnU-Net framework reveal the potential application of
  UnCLe SAM in dynamically changing environments like healthcare.Our code base will
  be made public upon acceptance.
