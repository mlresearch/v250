title: 'Medical diffusion on a budget: Textual Inversion for medical image generation'
abstract: Diffusion models for text-to-image generation, known for their efficiency,
  accessibility, and quality, have gained popularity. While inference with these systems
  on consumer-grade GPUs is increasingly feasible, training from scratch requires
  large captioned datasets and significant computational resources. In medical image
  generation, limited availability of large, publicly accessible datasets with text
  reports poses challenges due to legal and ethical concerns. This work shows that
  adapting pre-trained Stable Diffusion models to medical imaging modalities is achievable
  by training text embeddings using Textual Inversion.In this study, we experimented
  with small medical datasets (100 samples each from three modalities) and trained
  within hours to generate diagnostically accurate images, as judged by an expert
  radiologist. Experiments with Textual Inversion training and inference parameters
  reveal the necessity of larger embeddings and more examples in the medical domain.
  Classification experiments show an increase in diagnostic accuracy (AUC) for detecting
  prostate cancer on MRI, from 0.78 to 0.80. Further experiments demonstrate embedding
  flexibility through disease interpolation, combining pathologies, and inpainting
  for precise disease appearance control. Notably, the trained embeddings are compact
  (less than 1 MB), enabling easy data sharing with reduced privacy concerns.
