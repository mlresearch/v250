title: A Patch-based Student-Teacher Pyramid Matching Approach to Anomaly Detection
  in 3D Magnetic Resonance Imaging
abstract: Anomaly detection on 3D magnet resonance images (MRI) is of high medical
  relevance in the context of detecting lesions associated with different diseases.
  Yet, reliable anomaly detection in MRI images involves major challenges, specifically
  taking into account information in 3D, and the need to localize relatively small
  and subtle abnormalities within the context of whole organ MRIs. In this paper,
  a top-down approach, which uses student-teacher feature pyramid matching (STFPM)
  for detecting anomalies at image and voxel level, is applied to 3D brain MRI inputs.
  The combination of a 3D patch based self-supervised pre-training and axial-coronal-sagittal
  (ACS) convolutions pushes the performance above that of f-AnoGAN (bottom-up). The
  evaluation is based on a tumor dataset.
