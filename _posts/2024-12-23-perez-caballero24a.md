title: Unsupervised Deep Learning Method for Bias Correction
abstract: In this paper, a new method for automatic MR image inhomogeneity correction
  is proposed. This method, based on deep learning, uses unsupervised learning to
  estimate the bias corrected images minimizing a cost function based on the entropy
  of the corrupted image, the derivative of the estimated bias field and corrected
  image statistics. The proposed method has been compared with the state-of-the-art
  method N4 providing improved results.
