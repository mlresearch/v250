title: 'HoVer-NeXt: A Fast Nuclei Segmentation and Classification Pipeline for Next
  Generation Histopathology'
abstract: 'In cancer, a variety of cell types, along with their local density and
  spatial organization within tissues, play a key role in driving cancer progression
  and modulating patient outcomes. At the basis of cancer diagnosis is the histopathological
  assessment of tissues, stained by hematoxylin & eosin (H&E), which gives the nuclei
  of cells a dark purple appearance, making them particularly distinguishable and
  quantifiable. The identification of individual nuclei, whether in a proliferating
  (mitosis) or resting state, and their further phenotyping (e.g. immune cells) is
  the foundation on which histopathology images can be used for further investigations
  into cellular interaction, prognosis or response prediction. To this end, we develop
  a H&E based nuclei segmentation and classification model that is both fast (1.8s/mm2
  at 0.5mpp, 3.2s/mm2 at 0.25mpp) and accurate (0.84 binary F1, 0.758 mean balanced
  Accuracy) which allows us to investigate the cellular composition of large-scale
  colorectal cancer (CRC) cohorts. We extend the publicly available Lizard CRC nuclei
  dataset with a mitosis class and publish further validation data for the rarest
  classes: mitosis and eosinophils. Moreover, our pipeline is 5× faster than the CellViT
  pipeline, 17× faster than the HoVer-Net pipeline, and performs competitively on
  the PanNuke pan-cancer nuclei dataset (47.7 mPQTiss, +3% over HoVer-Net). Our work
  paves the way towards extensive single-cell information directly from H&E slides,
  leading to a quantitative view of whole slide images. Code, model weights as well
  as all additional training and validation data, are publicly available on github.'
