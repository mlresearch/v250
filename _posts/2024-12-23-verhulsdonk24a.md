title: 'Shape of my heart: Cardiac models through learned signed distance functions'
abstract: The efficient construction of anatomical models is one of the major challenges
  of patientspecific in-silico models of the human heart. Current methods frequently
  rely on linear statistical models, allowing no advanced topological changes, or
  requiring medical image segmentation followed by a meshing pipeline, which strongly
  depends on image resolution, quality, and modality. These approaches are therefore
  limited in their transferability to other imaging domains. In this work, the cardiac
  shape is reconstructed by means of threedimensional deep signed distance functions
  with Lipschitz regularity. For this purpose, the shapes of cardiac MRI reconstructions
  are learned to model the spatial relation of multiple chambers. We demonstrate that
  this approach is also capable of reconstructing anatomical models from partial data,
  such as point clouds from a single ventricle, or modalities different from the trained
  MRI, such as the electroanatomical mapping (EAM).
