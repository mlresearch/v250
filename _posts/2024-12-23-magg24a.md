title: Training-free Prompt Placement by Propagation for SAM Predictions in Bone CT
  Scans
abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is an interactive foundation segmentation
  model, showing impressive results for 2D natural images using prompts such as points
  and boxes. Transferring these results to medical image segmentation is challenging
  due to the 3D nature of medical images and the high demand of manual interaction.
  As a 2D architecture, SAM is applied slice-per-slice to a 3D medical scan. This
  hinders the application of SAM for volumetric medical scans since at least one prompt
  per class for each single slice is needed. In our work, the applicability is improve
  by reducing the number of necessary user-generated prompts. We introduce and evaluate
  multiple training-free strategies to automatically place box prompts in bone CT
  volumes, given only one initial box prompt per class. The average performance of
  our methods ranges from 54.22% Dice to 88.26% Dice. At the same time, the number
  of annotated pixels is reduced significantly from a few millions to two pixels per
  class. These promising results underline the potential of foundation models in medical
  image segmentation, paving the way for annotation-efficient, general approaches.
