title: Learned morphological features guide cell type assignment of deconvolved spatial
  transcriptomics
abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables to study the relationship between gene expression
  and tissue organization. Despite many recent advancements, existing sequencing-based
  methods have a spatial resolution that limits identification of individual cells.  To
  address this, several cell type deconvolution methods have been proposed to integrate
  spatial gene expression with single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing, producing
  per spot cell typing. However, these methods often overlook the contribution of
  morphology, which means cell identities are randomly assigned to the nuclei within
  a spot. In this paper, we introduce MHAST, a morphology-guided hierarchical permutation-based
  framework which efficiently reassigns cell types in spatial transcriptomics. We
  validate our method on simulated data, synthetic data, and a use case on the broadly
  used Tangram cell type deconvolution method with Visium data. We show that deconvolution-based
  cell typing using morphological tissue features from self-supervised deep learning
  lead to a more accurate annotation of the cells.
