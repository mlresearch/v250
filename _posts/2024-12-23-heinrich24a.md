title: Implicit neural obfuscation for privacy preserving medical image sharing
abstract: Despite its undeniable success, deep learning for medical imaging with large
  public datasets leads to an often overlooked risk of leaking sensitive patient information.
  A personś X-ray, even with proper anonymisation applied, can readily serve as fingerprint
  and would enable a highly accurate re-identification of the same individual in a
  large pool of scans. Common practices for reducing privacy risks involve a synthetic
  deterioration of image quality, e.g. by adding noise or downsampling images, before
  sharing them publicly. Yet, this also adversely affects the quality of downstream
  image recognition models trained on such datasets. We propose a novel strategy for
  finding a better compromise of model quality and privacy preservation by means of
  implicit neural obfuscation. Our method jointly overfits a neural network to a small
  batch of patientsX́-ray scans and applies a substantial compression - the number
  of network parameters representing the images is more than 6x smaller than the original
  images. In addition, we introduce a k-anonymity mixing that injects partial information
  from other patients for each reconstruction. That way identifiable information is
  efficiently obfuscated, while we manage to maintain the quality of relevant image
  parts for the intended downstream task. Experimental validation on the public RANZCR
  CLiP dataset demonstrates improved segmentation quality and up to 3 times reduced
  privacy risks compared to a more basic image obfuscation baselines. In contrast
  to other recent work that learn specific anonymous representations, which no longer
  resemble visually meaningful scans, our approach remains interpretable and is not
  tied to a certain downstream network. Source code and a demo dataset are available
