title: 'Video-CT MAE: Self-supervised Video-CT Domain Adaptation for Vertebral Fracture
  Diagnosis'
abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of vertebral body anomalies is crucial for
  effectively treating spinal disorders, but the manual interpretation of CT scans
  can be time-consuming and error-prone. While deep learning has shown promise in
  automating vertebral fracture detection, improving the interpretability of existing
  methods is crucial for building trust and ensuring reliable clinical application.
  Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer inherent interpretability through attention visualizations
  but are limited in their application to 3D medical images due to reliance on 2D
  image pretraining. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach combining
  the benefits of transfer learning from video-pretrained models and domain adaptation
  with self-supervised pretraining on a task-specific but unlabeled dataset. Compared
  to naive transfer learning from Video MAE, our method shows improved downstream
  task performance by 8.3 in F1 and a training speedup of factor 2. This closes the
  gap between videos and medical images, allowing a ViT to learn relevant anatomical
  features while adapting to the task domain. We demonstrate that our framework enables
  ViTs to effectively detect vertebral fractures in a low data regime, outperforming
  CNN-based state-of-the-art methods while providing inherent interpretability. Our
  task adaptation approach and dataset not only improve the performance of our proposed
  method but also enhance existing self-supervised pretraining approaches, highlighting
  the benefits of task-specific self-supervised pretraining for domain adaptation.
  The code is publicly available.
