title: Semi-Supervised Segmentation via Embedding Matching
abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks are widely used in medical image segmentation
  but require many labeled images for training. Annotating three-dimensional medical
  images is a time-consuming and costly process. To overcome this limitation, we propose
  a novel semi-supervised segmentation method that leverages mostly unlabeled images
  and a small set of labeled images in training. Our approach involves assessing prediction
  uncertainty to identify reliable predictions on unlabeled voxels from the teacher
  model. These voxels serve as pseudo-labels for training the student model. In voxels
  where the teacher model produces unreliable predictions, pseudo-labeling is carried
  out based on voxel-wise embedding correspondence using reference voxels from labeled
  images.We applied this method to automate hip bone segmentation in CT images, achieving
  notable results with just 4 CT scans. The proposed approach yielded a Hausdorff
  distance with 95th percentile (HD95) of 3.30 and IoU of 0.929, surpassing existing
  methods achieving HD95 (4.07) and IoU (0.927) at their best.
