title: Interpretable Uncertainty-Aware Deep Regression with Cohort Saliency Analysis
  for Three-Slice CT Imaging Studies
abstract: 'Obesity is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality.
  Achieving a healthy body composition, which involves maintaining a balance between
  fat and muscle mass, is important for metabolic health and preventing chronic diseases.
  Computed tomography (CT) imaging offers detailed insights into the body’s internal
  structure, aiding in understanding body composition and its related factors. In
  this feasibility study, we utilized CT image data from 2,724 subjects from the large
  metabolic health cohort studies SCAPIS and IGT. We train and evaluate an uncertainty-aware
  deep regression based ResNet-50 network, which outputs its prediction as mean and
  variance, for quantification of cross-sectional areas of liver, visceral adipose
  tissue (VAT), and thigh muscle. This was done using collages of three single-slice
  CT images from the liver, abdomen, and thigh regions. The model demonstrated promising
  results with the evaluation metrics – including R-squared ($R^2$) and mean absolute
  error (MAE) for predictions. Additionally, for interpretability, the model was evaluated
  with saliency analysis based on Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)
  at stages 2, 3, and 4 of the network. Deformable image registration to a template
  subject further enabled cohort saliency analysis that provide group-wise visualization
  of image regions of importance for associations to biomarkers of interest. We found
  that the networks focus on relevant regions for each target, according to prior
  knowledge. The source code is available at: \url{https://github.com/noumannahmad/dr_3slice_ct}.'
