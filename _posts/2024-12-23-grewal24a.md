title: Multi-Objective Learning for Deformable Image Registration
abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) involves optimization of multiple conflicting
  objectives, however, not many existing DIR algorithms are multi-objective (MO).
  Further, while there has been progress in the design of deep learning algorithms
  for DIR, there is no work in the direction of MO DIR using deep learning. In this
  paper, we fill this gap by combining a recently proposed approach for MO training
  of neural networks with a well-known deep neural network for DIR and create a deep
  learning based MO DIR approach. We evaluate the proposed approach for DIR of pelvic
  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed
  MO DIR approach – providing multiple DIR outputs for each patient that each correspond
  to a different trade-off between the objectives – has additional desirable properties
  from a clinical use point-of-view as compared to providing a single DIR output.
  The experiments also show that the proposed MO DIR approach provides a better spread
  of DIR outputs across the entire trade-off front than simply training multiple neural
  networks with weights for each objective sampled from a grid of possible values.
