title: Boundary-aware Contrastive Learning for Semi-supervised Nuclei Instance Segmentation
abstract: 'Semi-supervised segmentation methods have demonstrated promising results
  in natural scenarios, providing a solution to reduce dependency on manual annotation.
  However, these methods face significant challenges when directly applied to pathological
  images due to the subtle color differences between nuclei and tissues, as well as
  the significant morphological variations among nuclei. Consequently, the generated
  pseudo-labels often contain much noise, especially at the nuclei boundaries. To
  address the above problem, this paper proposes a boundary-aware contrastive learning
  network to denoise the boundary noise in a semi-supervised nuclei segmentation task.
  The model has two key designs: a low-resolution denoising (LRD) module and a cross-RoI
  contrastive learning (CRC) module. The LRD improves the smoothness of the nuclei
  boundary by pseudo-labels denoising, and the CRC enhances the discrimination between
  foreground and background by boundary feature contrastive learning. We conduct extensive
  experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing
  semi-supervised instance segmentation methods.'
