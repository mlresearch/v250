title: Efficiently correcting patch-based segmentation errors to control image-level
  performance in retinal images
abstract: Segmentation models which are deployed into clinical practice need to meet
  a quality standard for each image. Even when models perform well on average, they
  may fail at segmenting individual images with a sufficiently high quality. We propose
  a combined quality control and error correction framework to reach the desired segmentation
  quality in each image. Our framework recommends the necessary number of local patches
  for manual review and estimates the impact of the intervention on the Dice Score
  of the corrected segmentation. This allows to trade off segmentation quality against
  time invested into manual review. We select the patches based on uncertainty maps
  obtained from an ensemble of segmentation models. We evaluated our method on retinal
  vessel segmentation on fundus images, where the Dice Score increased substantially
  after reviewing only a few patches. Our method accurately estimated the review’s
  impact on the Dice Score and we found that our framework controls the quality standard
  efficiently, i.e. reviewing as little as necessary.
