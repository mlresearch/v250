title: 'Deep blind arterial input function: signal correction in perfusion cardiac
  magnetic resonance'
abstract: 'Objectives: The non-linear relationship between gadolinium concentration
  and the signal in perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) poses a significant
  challenge for accurate quantification of pharmacokinetic parameters. This phenomenon
  primarily impacts the arterial input function (AIF), causing it to appear saturated
  in comparison to the temporal concentration profile. This study aims to leverage
  a blind deconvolution strategy through a deep-learning approach to address the saturation
  in the AIF.Methods: We propose the utilization of a convolutional neural network
  (CNN) architecture with the saturated AIF and a set of myocardial tissue signals
  as inputs, generating the corrected AIF as the output. To train the network, a dataset
  comprising over 3×10^6 simulated AIFs with associated signals from five simulated
  tissues response for each instance was employed. To assess the effectiveness of
  the approach, the trained network was evaluated using a dual-saturation sequence
  to compare the corrected AIF with the unsaturated version. The clinical dataset
  encompassed scans from 43 patients.Results: The mean square error (MSE) for the
  testing subset of the simulated database was 0.69% of the peak. In the in vivo dataset,
  the coefficient of determination R2 was 0.26 and 0.86 for the saturated and corrected
  AIF, respectively, in comparison to the unsaturated AIF.Conclusion: The proposed
  network successfully corrects the acquisition-induced effects on the AIF. Moreover,
  the extensive simulated database, featuring diverse acquisition parameters, facilitates
  the robust generalization of the networkś application.'
