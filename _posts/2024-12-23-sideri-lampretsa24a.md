title: 'SINR: Spline-enhanced implicit neural representation for multi-modal registration'
abstract: Deformable image registration has undergone a transformative shift with
  the advent of deep learning. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) allow for
  accelerated registration, they exhibit reduced accuracy compared to iterative pairwise
  optimization methods and require extensive training cohorts. Based on the advances
  in representing signals with neural networks, implicit neural representations (INRs)
  have emerged in the registration community to model dense displacement fields continuously.
  Using a pairwise registration setup, INRs mitigate the bias learned over a cohort
  of patients while leveraging advanced methodology and gradient-based optimization.
  However, the coordinate sampling scheme makes dense transformation parametrization
  with an INR prone to generating physiologically implausible configurations resulting
  in spatial folding. In this paper, we introduce SINR - a method to parameterize
  the continuous deformable transformation represented by an INR using Free Form Deformations
  (FFD). SINR allows for multi-modal deformable registration while mitigating folding
  issues found in current INR-based registration methods. SINR outperforms existing
  state-of-the-art methods on both 3D mono- and multi-modal brain registration on
  the CamCAN dataset, demonstrating its capabilities for pairwise mono- and multi-modal
  image registration.
