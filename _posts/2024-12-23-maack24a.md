title: Efficient Anatomy Segmentation in Laparoscopic Surgery using Multi-Teacher
  Knowledge Distillation
abstract: Automatic segmentation of anatomical structures in laparoscopic images or
  videos is an important prerequisite for visual assistance tools which are designed
  to increase efficiency and safety during an intervention.In order to be used in
  a realistic clinical scenario, both high accuracy and real-time capability are required.Current
  deep learning networks for anatomy segmentation show high accuracy, but are not
  suitable for real-time clinical application due to their large size.As smaller,
  real-time capable deep learning networks show lower segmentation performance, we
  propose a multi-teacher knowledge distillation approach applicable to partially
  labeled datasets.We leverage the knowledge of multiple anatomy-specific, high-accuracy
  teacher networks to improve the segmentation performance of a single and efficient
  student network capable of segmenting multiple anatomies simultaneously.To do so,
  we minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the normalized anatomy-specific
  teacher logits and the respective normalized logits of the student.We conduct experiments
  on the Dresden Surgical Anatomy Dataset, which provides multiple subsets of binary
  segmented anatomical structures.Results show that our approach can increase the
  overall Dice score for different real-time capable network architectures for anatomy
  segmentation.
