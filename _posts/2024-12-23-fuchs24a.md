title: 'HARP: Unsupervised Histopathology Artifact Restoration'
abstract: Histopathological analysis, vital for medical diagnostics, is often challenged
  by artifacts insample preparation and imaging, such as staining inconsistencies
  and physical obstructions.Addressing this, our work introduces a novel, fully unsupervised
  histopathological artifactrestoration pipeline (HARP). HARP integrates artifact
  detection, localization, and restorationinto one pipeline. The first step to make
  artifact restoration applicable is an analysisof anomaly detection algorithms. Then,
  HARP leverages the power of unsupervised segmentationtechniques to propose localizations
  for potential artifacts, for which we select thebest localization based on our novel
  inpainting denoising diffusion model. Finally, HARPemploys an inpainting model for
  artifact restoration while conditioning it on the artifact localizations.We evaluate
  the artifact detection quality along with the image reconstructionquality, surpassing
  the state-of-the-art artifact restoration. Furthermore, we demonstratethat HARP
  improves the robustness and reliability of downstream models and show thatpathologists
  can not tell the difference between clean images and images restored throughHARP.
  This demonstrates that HARP significantly improves image quality and diagnosticreliability,
  enhancing histopathological examination accuracy for AI systems.
