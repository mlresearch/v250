title: 'Re-DiffiNet: Modeling discrepancy in tumor segmentation using diffusion models'
abstract: 'Identification of tumor margins is essential for surgical decision-making
  for glioblastoma patients and provides reliable assistance for neurosurgeons. Despite
  improvements in deep learning architectures for tumor segmentation over the years,
  creating a fully autonomous system suitable for clinical floors remains a formidable
  challenge because the model predictions have not yet reached the desired level of
  accuracy and generalizability for clinical applications. Generative modeling techniques
  have seen significant improvements in recent times. Specifically, Generative Adversarial
  Networks (GANs) and Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have been used
  to generate higher-quality images with fewer artifacts and finer attributes. In
  this work, we introduce a framework called Re-Diffinet for modeling the discrepancy
  between the outputs of a segmentation model like U-Net and the ground truth, using
  DDPMs. By explicitly modeling the discrepancy, the results show an average improvement
  of 0.55% in the Dice score and 16.28% in 95% Hausdorff Distance from cross-validation
  over 5-folds, compared to the state-of-the-art U-Net segmentation model. The code
  is available:'
