title: Exploring Transfer Learning in Medical Image Segmentation using Vision-Language
  Models
abstract: Medical image segmentation allows quantifying target structure size and
  shape, aiding in disease diagnosis, prognosis, surgery planning, and comprehension.
  Building upon recent advancements in foundation Vision-Language Models (VLMs) from
  natural image-text pairs, several studies have proposed adapting them to Vision-Language
  Segmentation Models (VLSMs) that allow using language text as an additional input
  to segmentation models. Introducing auxiliary information via text with human-in-the-loop
  prompting during inference opens up unique opportunities, such as open vocabulary
  segmentation and potentially more robust segmentation models against out-of-distribution
  data.Although transfer learning from natural to medical images has been explored
  for image-only segmentation models, the joint representation of vision-language
  in segmentation problems remains underexplored. This study introduces the first
  systematic study on transferring VLSMs to 2D medical images, using carefully curated
  $11$ datasets encompassing diverse modalities and insightful language prompts and
  experiments. Our findings demonstrate that although VLSMs show competitive performance
  compared to image-only modelsfor segmentation after finetuning in limited medical
  image datasets, not all VLSMs utilize the additional information from language prompts,
  with image features playing a dominant role. While VLSMs exhibit enhanced performance
  in handling pooled datasets with diversemodalities and show potential robustness
  to domain shifts compared to conventional segmentation models, our results suggest
  that novel approaches are required to enable VLSMs to leverage the various auxiliary
  information available through language prompts. The code and datasets are available
