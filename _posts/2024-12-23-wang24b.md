title: 'OFELIA: Optical Flow-based Electrode LocalIzAtion'
abstract: Catheter ablation is one of the most common cardiac ablation procedures
  for atrial fibrillation, which is mainly based on catheters with electrodes collecting
  electrophysiology signals.Catheter electrode localization facilitates intraoperative
  catheter positioning, surgical planning, and other applications such as 3D model
  reconstruction.In this paper, we propose a novel deep network for automatic electrode
  localization in an X-ray sequence, which integrates spatiotemporal features between
  adjacent frames, aided by optical flow maps.To improve the utility and robustness
  of the proposed method, we first design a saturation-based optical flow dataset
  construction pipeline, then finetune the optical flow estimation to obtain more
  realistic and contrasting optical flow maps for electrode localization.The extensive
  results on clinical-challenging test sequences reveal the effectiveness of our method,
  with a mean radial error (MRE) of 0.95 mm for radiofrequency catheters and an MRE
  of 0.71 mm for coronary sinus catheters, outperforming several state-of-the-art
  landmark detection methods.
