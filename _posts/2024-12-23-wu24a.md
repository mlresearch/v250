title: 'IST-editing: Infinite spatial transcriptomic editing in a generated gigapixel
  mouse pup'
abstract: Advanced spatial transcriptomics (ST) techniques provide comprehensive insights
  into complex organisms across multiple scales, while simultaneously posing challenges
  in biomedical image analysis. The spatial co-profiling of biological tissues by
  gigapixel whole slide images (WSI) and gene expression arrays motivates the development
  of innovative and efficient algorithmic approaches. Using Generative Adversarial
  Nets (GAN), we introduce **I**nfinite **S**patial **T**ranscriptomic **e**diting
  (IST-editing) and establish gene expression-guided editing in a generated gigapixel
  mouse pup. Trained with patch-wise high-plex gene expression (input) and matched
  image data (output), IST-editing enables the seamless synthesis of arbitrarily large
  bioimages at inference, *e.g.*, with a $106496 \times 53248$ resolution. After feeding
  edited gene expression values to the trained model, we simulate cell-, tissue- and
  animal-level morphological transitions in the generated mouse pup. Lastly, we discuss
  and evaluate editing effects on interpretable morphological features. The code and
  generated WSIs are publicly accessible via https://github.com/CTPLab/IST-editing.
