title: Hyperparameter-Free Medical Image Synthesis for Sharing Data and Improving
  Site-Specific Segmentation
abstract: Sharing synthetic medical images is a promising alternative to sharing real
  images that can improve patient privacy and data security. To get good results,
  existing methods for medical image synthesis must be manually adjusted when they
  are applied to unseen data. To remove this manual burden, we introduce a Hyperparameter-Free
  distributed learning method for automatic medical image Synthesis, Sharing, and
  Segmentation called HyFree-S3. For three diverse segmentation settings (pelvic MRIs,
  lung X-rays, polyp photos), the use of HyFree-S3 results in improved performance
  over training only with site-specific data (in the majority of cases). The hyperparameter-free
  nature of the method should make data synthesis and sharing easier, potentially
  leading to an increase in the quantity of available data and consequently the quality
  of the models trained that may ultimately be applied in the clinic. Our code is
