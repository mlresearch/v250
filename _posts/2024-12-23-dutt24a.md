title: 'Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Medical Image Analysis: The Missed Opportunity'
abstract: Foundation models have significantly advanced medical image analysis through
  the pre-train fine-tune paradigm. Among various fine-tuning algorithms, Parameter-Efficient
  Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is increasingly utilized for knowledge transfer across diverse
  tasks, including vision-language and text-to-image generation. However, its application
  in medical image analysis is relatively unexplored due to the lack of a structured
  benchmark for evaluating PEFT methods. This study fills this gap by evaluating 17
  distinct PEFT algorithms across convolutional and transformer-based networks on
  image classification and text-to-image generation tasks using six medical datasets
  of varying size, modality, and complexity. Through a battery of over 700 controlled
  experiments, our findings demonstrate PEFTÅ› effectiveness, particularly in low data
  regimes common in medical imaging, with performance gains of up to 22% in discriminative
  and generative tasks. These recommendations can assist the community in incorporating
  PEFT into their workflows and facilitate fair comparisons of future PEFT methods,
  ensuring alignment with advancements in other areas of machine learning and AI.
