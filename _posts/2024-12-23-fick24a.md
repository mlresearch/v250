title: Improving CNN-Based Mitosis Detection through Rescanning Annotated Glass Slides
  and Atypical Mitosis Subtyping
abstract: 'The identification of mitotic figures (MFs) is a routine task in the histopathological
  assessment of tumor malignancy with known limitations for human observers. For a
  machine learning pipeline to robustly detect MFs, it must overcome a variety of
  conditions such as different scanners, staining protocols, tissue configurations,
  and organ types. In order to develop a deep learning-based algorithm that can cope
  with these challenges, there are two obstacles that need to be overcome: obtaining
  a large-scale dataset of MF annotations spread across different domains of interest,
  including whole slide images (WSIs) exhaustively annotated for MFs, and using the
  annotated MFs in an efficient training process to extract the most relevant features
  for classification.Our work attempts to address both of these challenges and establishes
  an MF detection pipeline trained solely on animal data, yet competitive on the mixed
  human/animal MIDOG22 dataset, and, in particular, on human breast cancer.First,
  we propose a processing pipeline that allows us to strengthen the true scanner robustness
  of our dataset by physically rescanning the glass slides of annotated WSIs and registering
  MF positions. To enable the use of such rescans for training, we propose a novel
  learning paradigm tailored for labels that match partially, which allows to account
  for ambiguous MF positions in the rescans caused by spurious, suboptimal fine-focus
  on potential MFs by the scanner. Second, we demonstrate how a multi-task learning
  approach for MF subtypes, including the prediction of atypical mitotic figures (AMFs),
  can significantly enhance a model≈õ ability to distinguish MFs from imposters. Our
  algorithm, using a standard object detection pipeline, performs very competitively
  with an average test set F1 value across five runs of 0.80 on the MIDOG22 training
  set. We also demonstrate its ability to stratify overall survival on the TCGA-BRCA
  dataset based on mitotic density, though it falls short of reaching significance
  in stratifying survival based on AMFs.'
