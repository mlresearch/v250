title: 'Cell-DETR: Efficient cell detection and classification in WSIs with transformers'
abstract: Understanding cell interactions and subpopulation distribution is crucial
  for pathologists to support their diagnoses. This cell information is traditionally
  extracted from segmentation methods, which poses significant computational challenges
  on processing Whole Slide Images (WSIs) due to their giga-size nature. Nonetheless,
  the clinically relevant tasks are nuclei detection and classification rather than
  segmentation. In this manuscript, we undertake a comprehensive exploration of the
  applicability of detection transformers for cell detection and classification (Cell-DETR).
  Not only do we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by achieving state-of-the-art
  performance on well-established benchmarks, but we also develop a pipeline to tackle
  these tasks on WSIs at scale to enable the development of downstream applications.
  We show its efficiency and feasibility by reporting a x3.4 faster inference time
  on a dataset featuring large WSIs. By addressing the challenges associated with
  large-scale cell detection, our work contributes valuable insights that paves the
  way for the development of scalable diagnosis pipelines based on cell-level information.
