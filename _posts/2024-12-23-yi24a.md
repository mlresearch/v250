title: 'PAAN: Pyramid Attention Augmented Network for polyp segmentation'
abstract: Polyp segmentation is a task of segmenting polyp lesion regions from normal
  tissues in medical images, which is crucial for medical diagnosis and treatment
  planning. However, existing methods still suffer from low accuracy in polyp boundary
  delineation and insufficient suppression of irrelevant background due to the blur
  boundaries and textures of polyps. To overcome these limitations, in this paper
  a Pyramid Attention Augmented Network (PAAN) is proposed, in which a pyramid feature
  diversion structure with spatial attention mechanism is developed so that good feature
  representation with low information loss can be achieved by conducting channel attention-based
  feature diversion and inter-layer fusion, while reducing computational complexity.
  Also, our framework includes an Enhanced Spatial Attention module (ESA), which can
  improve the quality of initial polyp segmentation predictions through spatial self-attention
  mechanism and multi-scale feature fusion. Our approach is evaluated on five challenging
  polyp datasetsâ€” Kvasir, CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-300, ETIS, and CVC-colonDB and achieves
  excellent results. In particular, we achieve 94.2% Dice and 89.7% IoU on Kvasir,
  outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.
