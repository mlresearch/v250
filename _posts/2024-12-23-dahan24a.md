title: The Multiscale Surface Vision Transformer
abstract: Surface meshes are a favoured domain for representing structural and functional
  information on the human cortex, but their complex topology and geometry pose significant
  challenges for deep learning analysis. While Transformers have excelled as domain-agnostic
  architectures for sequence-to-sequence learning, the quadratic cost of the self-attention
  operation remains an obstacle for many dense prediction tasks. Inspired by some
  of the latest advances in hierarchical modelling with vision transformers, we introduce
  the Multiscale Surface Vision Transformer (MS-SiT) as a backbone architecture for
  surface deep learning. The self-attention mechanism is applied within local-mesh-windows
  to allow for high-resolution sampling of the underlying data, while a shifted-window
  strategy improves the sharing of information between windows. Neighbouring patches
  are successively merged, allowing the MS-SiT to learn hierarchical representations
  suitable for any prediction task. Results demonstrate that the MS-SiT outperforms
  existing surface deep learning methods for neonatal phenotyping prediction tasks
  using the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) dataset. Furthermore, building
  the MS-SiT backbone into a U-shaped architecture for surface segmentation demonstrates
  competitive results on cortical parcellation using the UK Biobank (UKB) and manually-annotated
  MindBoggle datasets. Code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/metrics-lab/surface-vision-transformers.
