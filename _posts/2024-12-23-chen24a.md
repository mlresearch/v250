title: 'FedFDD: Federated Learning with Frequency Domain Decomposition for Low-Dose
  CT Denoising'
abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) enables imaging with minimal radiation
  exposure but typically results in noisy outputs. Deep learning algorithms have been
  emerging as popular tools for denoising LDCT images, where they typically rely on
  large data sets requiring data from multiple centers. However, LDCT images collected
  from different centers (clients) can present significant data heterogeneity, and
  the sharing of them between clients is also constrained by privacy regulations.
  In this work, we propose a personalized federated learning (FL) approach for enhancing
  model generalization across different organ images from multiple local clients while
  preserving data privacy. Empirically, we find that earlier FL methods tend to underperform
  single-set models on non-IID LDCT data due to the presence of data heterogeneity
  characterized by varying frequency patterns. To address this, we introduce a Federated
  Learning with Frequency Domain Decomposition (FedFDD) approach, which decomposes
  images into different frequency components and then updates high-frequency signals
  in an FL setting while preserving local low-frequency characteristics. Specifically,
  we leverage an adaptive frequency mask with discrete cosine transformation for the
  frequency domain decomposition. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on LDCT datasets
  of different organs and our experimental results show that FedFDD can surpass state-of-the-art
  FL methods as well as both localized and centralized models, especially on challenging
  LDCT denoising cases. Our code is available at https://github.com/xuhang2019/FedFDD.
