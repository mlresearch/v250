title: Conditional Generation of 3D Brain Tumor Regions via VQGAN and Temporal-Agnostic
  Masked Transformer
abstract: Neuroradiology studies often suffer from lack of sufficient data to properly
  train deep learning models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can mitigate
  this problem by generating synthetic images to augment training datasets. However,
  GANs sometimes are unstable and struggle to produce high-resolution, realistic,
  and diverse images. An alternative solution is Diffusion Probabilistic Models, but
  these models require extensive computational resources. Additionally, most of the
  existing generation models are designed to generate the entire image volumes, rather
  than the regions of interest (ROIs) such as the tumor region. Research on brain
  tumor classification using magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) has shown that it is
  easier to classify the ROIs compared to the entire image volumes. To this end, we
  present a class-conditioned ROI generation framework that combines a conditional
  vector-quantization GAN and a class-conditioned masked Transformer to generate high-resolution
  and diverse 3D brain tumor ROIs. We also propose a temporal-agnostic masking strategy
  to effectively learn relationships between semantic tokens in the latent space.
  Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can generate high-quality 3D
  MRIs of brain tumor regions for both low- and high-grade glioma (LGG/HGG) in the
  BraTS 2019 dataset. Using the generated data, our approach demonstrates superior
  performance compared to several baselines in a downstream task of brain tumor type
  classification. Our proposed method has the potential to facilitate accurate diagnosis
  of rare brain tumors using MRI-based machine learning models.
