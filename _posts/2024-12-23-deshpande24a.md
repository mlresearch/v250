title: Auto-Generating Weak Labels for Real & Synthetic Data to Improve Label-Scarce
  Medical Image Segmentation
abstract: The high cost of creating pixel-by-pixel gold-standard labels, limited expert
  availability, and presence of diverse tasks make it challenging to generate segmentation
  labels to train deep learning models for medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
  present a new approach to overcome the hurdle of costly medical image labeling by
  leveraging foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its medical alternate
  MedSAM. Our pipeline has the ability to generate *weak labels* for any unlabeled
  medical image and subsequently use it to augment label-scarce datasets. We perform
  this by leveraging a model trained on a few gold-standard labels and using it to
  intelligently prompt MedSAM for weak label generation. This automation eliminates
  the manual prompting step in MedSAM, creating a streamlined process for generating
  labels for both real and synthetic images, regardless of quantity. We conduct experiments
  on label-scarce settings for multiple tasks pertaining to modalities ranging from
  ultrasound, dermatology, and X-rays to demonstrate the usefulness of our pipeline.
  The code will be made public after review.
