title: Deformation-aware GAN for Medical Image Synthesis with Substantially Misaligned
  Pairs
abstract: Medical image synthesis generates additional imaging modalities that are
  costly, invasive or harmful to acquire, which helps to facilitate the clinical workflow.
  When training pairs are substantially misaligned (e.g., lung MRI-CT pairs with respiratory
  motion), accurate image synthesis remains a critical challenge. Recent works explored
  the directional registration module to adjust misalignment in generative adversarial
  networks (GANs); however, substantial misalignment will lead to 1) suboptimal data
  mapping caused by correspondence ambiguity, and 2) degraded image fidelity caused
  by morphology influence on discriminators. To address the challenges, we propose
  a novel Deformation-aware GAN (DA-GAN) to dynamically correct the misalignment during
  the image synthesis based on multi-objective inverse consistency. Specifically,
  in the generative process, three levels of inverse consistency cohesively optimise
  symmetric registration and image generation for improved correspondence. In the
  adversarial process, to further improve image fidelity under misalignment, we design
  deformation-aware discriminators to disentangle the mismatched spatial morphology
  from the judgement of image fidelity. Experimental results show that DA-GAN achieved
  superior performance on a public dataset with simulated misalignments and a real-world
  lung MRI-CT dataset with respiratory motion misalignment. The results indicate the
  potential for a wide range of medical image synthesis tasks such as radiotherapy
  planning.
