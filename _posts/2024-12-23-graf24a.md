title: Modeling the acquisition shift between axial and sagittal MRI for diffusion
  superresolution to enable axial spine segmentation
abstract: Spine MRIs are usually acquired in highly anisotropic 2D axial or sagittal
  slices. Vertebra structures are not fully resolved in these images, and multi-image
  superresolution by aligning scans to pair them is difficult due to partial volume
  effects and inter-vertebral movement during acquisition. Hence, we propose an unpaired
  inpainting superresolution algorithm that extrapolates the missing spine structures.
  We generate synthetic training pairs by multiple degradation functions that model
  the data shift and acquisition errors between sagittal slices and sagittal views
  of axial images. Our method employs modeling of the k-space point spread function
  and the interslice gap. Further, we imitate different MR acquisition challenges
  like histogram shifts, bias fields, interlace movement artifacts, Gaussian noise,
  and blur. This enables the training of diffusion-based superresolution models on
  scaling factors larger than 6$\times$ without real paired data. The low z-resolution
  in axial images prevents existing approaches from separating individual vertebrae
  instances. By applying this superresolution model to the z-dimension, we can generate
  images that allow a pre-trained segmentation model to distinguish between vertebrae
  and enable automatic segmentation and processing of axial images. We experimentally
  benchmark our method and show that diffusion-based superresolution outperforms state-of-the-art
  super-resolution models.
