title: Parameter-Efficient Generation of Natural Language Explanations for Chest X-ray
  Classification
abstract: The increased interest and importance of explaining neural networks\â€™{predictions},
  especially in the medical community, associated with the known unreliability of
  saliency maps, the most common explainability method, has sparked research into
  other types of explanations. Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) emerge as an alternative,
  with the advantage of being inherently understandable by humans and the standard
  way that radiologists explain their diagnoses. We extend upon previous work on NLE
  generation for multi-label chest X-ray diagnosis by replacing the traditional decoder-only
  NLE generator with an encoder-decoder architecture. This constitutes a first step
  towards Reinforcement Learning-free adversarial generation of NLEs when no (or few)
  ground-truth NLEs are available for training, since the generation is done in the
  continuous encoder latent space, instead of in the discrete decoder output space.However,
  in the current scenario, large amounts of annotated examples are still required,
  which are especially costly to obtain in the medical domain, given that they need
  to be provided by clinicians. Thus, we explore how the recent developments in Parameter-Efficient
  Fine-Tuning (PEFT) can be leveraged for this use-case. We compare different PEFT
  methods and find that integrating the visual information into the NLE generator
  layers instead of only at the input achieves the best results, even outperforming
  the fully fine-tuned encoder-decoder-based model, while only training 12% of the
  model parameters. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate the viability of supervising
  the NLE generation process on the encoder latent space, thus laying the foundation
  for RL-free adversarial training in low ground-truth NLE availability regimes. The
  code is publicly available at https://github.com/to_be_added.
