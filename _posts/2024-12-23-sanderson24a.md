title: Diffusion X-ray image denoising
abstract: X-ray imaging is a cornerstone in medical diagnosis, constituting a significant
  portion of the radiation dose encountered by patients. Excessive radiation poses
  health risks, particularly for pediatric patients, but despite the imperative to
  reduce radiation doses, conventional image processing methods for X-ray denoising
  often struggle with heuristic parameter calibration and prolonged execution times.
  Deep Learning solutions have emerged as promising alternatives, but their effectiveness
  varies, and challenges persist in preserving image quality.This paper presents an
  exploration of diffusion models for planar X-ray image denoising, a novel approach
  that to our knowledge has not been yet investigated in this domain. We perform real
  time denoising of Poisson noise while preserving image resolution and structural
  similarity. The results indicate that diffusion models show promise for planar X-ray
  image denoising, offering a potential improvement in the optimization of diagnostic
  utility amid dose reduction efforts.
