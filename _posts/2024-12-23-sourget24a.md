title: "[Citation needed] Data usage and citation practices in medical imaging conferences"
abstract: 'Medical imaging papers often focus on methodology, but the quality of the
  algorithms and the validity of the conclusions are highly dependent on the datasets
  used. As creating datasets requires a lot of effort, researchers often use publicly
  available datasets, there is however no adopted standard for citing the datasets
  used in scientific papers, leading to difficulty in tracking dataset usage.In this
  work, we present two open-source tools we created that could help with the detection
  of dataset usage, a pipeline using OpenAlex and full-text analysis, and a PDF annotation
  software used in our study to manually label the presence of datasets. We applied
  both tools on a study of the usage of 20 publicly available medical datasets in
  papers from MICCAI and MIDL. We compute the proportion and the evolution between
  2013 and 2023 of 3 types of presence in a paper: cited, mentioned in the full text,
  cited and mentioned. Our findings demonstrate the concentration of the usage of
  a limited set of datasets. We also highlight different citing practices, making
  the automation of tracking difficult.'
