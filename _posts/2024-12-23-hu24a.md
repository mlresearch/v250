title: 'ICL-SAM: Synergizing In-context Learning Model and SAM in Medical Image Segmentation'
abstract: Medical image segmentation, a field facing domain shifts due to diverse
  imaging modal- ities and biomedical domains, has made strides with the development
  of robust models. The In-Context Learning (ICL) model, like UniverSeg, demonstrates
  robustness to domain shifts with support image-label pairs in varied medical imaging
  segmentation tasks. How- ever, its performance is still unsatisfied. On the other
  hand, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) stands out as a powerful universal segmentation
  model. In this work, we intro- duce a novel methodology, ICL-SAM, that integrates
  the superior performance of SAM with the ICL model to create more effective segmentation
  models within the in-context learning paradigm. Our approach employs SAM to refine
  segmentation results from ICL model and leverages ICL model to generate prompts
  for SAM, eliminating the need for manual prompt provision. Additionally, we introduce
  a semantic confidence map gener- ation method into our framework to guide the prediction
  of both ICL model and SAM, thereby further enhancing segmentation accuracy. Our
  method has been extensively eval- uated across multiple medical imaging contexts,
  including fundus, MRI, and CT images, spanning five datasets. The results demonstrate
  significant performance improvements, particularly in settings with few support
  pairs, where our method can achieve over a 10% increase in the Dice coefficient
  compared to cutting edge ICL model. Our code will be publicly available.
