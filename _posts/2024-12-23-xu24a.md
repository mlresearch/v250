title: Feasibility and benefits of joint learning from MRI databases with different
  brain diseases and modalities for segmentation
abstract: 'Models for segmentation of brain lesions in multi-modal MRI are commonly
  trained for a specific pathology using a single database with a predefined set of
  MRI modalities, determined by a protocol for the specific disease.This work explores
  the following open questions: Is it feasible to train a model using multiple databases
  that contain varying sets of MRI modalities and annotations for different brain
  pathologies? Will this joint learning benefit performance on the sets of modalities
  and pathologies available during training? Will it enable analysis of new databases
  with different sets of modalities and pathologies? We develop and compare different
  methods and show that promising results can be achieved with appropriate, simple
  and practical alterations to the model and training framework. We experiment with
  7 databases containing 5 types of brain pathologies and different sets of MRI modalities.
  Results demonstrate, for the first time, that joint training on multi-modal MRI
  databases with different brain pathologies and sets of modalities is feasible and
  offers practical benefits. It enables a single model to segment pathologies encountered
  during training in diverse sets of modalities, while facilitating segmentation of
  new types of pathologies such as via follow-up fine-tuning. The insights this study
  provides into the potential and limitations of this paradigm should prove useful
  for guiding future advances in the direction. Code and pretrained models: https://github.com/WenTXuL/MultiUnet'
