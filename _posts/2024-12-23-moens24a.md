title: 'Laparoflow-SSL: Image Analysis From a Tiny Dataset Through Self-Supervised
  Transformers Leveraging Unlabeled Surgical Video'
abstract: During minimally invasive surgery, surgeons monitor their actions and the
  relevant tissue through a camera. This provides an ideal environment for artificial
  intelligence (AI) assisted surgery. For the development of such AI components, the
  need for expert annotations remains a key bottleneck. In this paper, we study the
  application of self-supervised learning (SSL) on surgical data. In a self-supervised
  setting, a representation backbone is trained on information that is inherently
  present in the data. There is no need for annotations, leaving the backbone free
  to train on all recordings, not just labeled ones. We leveraged optical flow for
  weighting pairs in a view-contrastive self-supervised learning loss. Constructed
  as an Info Noise-Contrastive Estimation (InfoNCE) loss, it contrasted the pixel
  representations of two differently, photometrically and geometrically transformed
  views. The importance of each contrasted pixel pair is determined by computing the
  difference between the optical flows of the respective pixels. In this way, the
  optical flow guided the representations of pixels that move together to similar
  vectors. We tested the usefulness of the representation vectors by training simple
  networks for semantic segmentation or robotic instrument key point detection. These
  networks showed competitive performance, even when using over 92% fewer annotated
  samples than other works. For semantic segmentation, we used as little as 99.73%
  fewer samples for training, originating from the m2caiSeg dataset, and remained
  competitive even when testing on the unseen cholecSeg8k dataset.
