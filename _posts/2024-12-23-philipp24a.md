title: Annotation-Efficient Strategy for Segmentation of 3D Body Composition
abstract: 'Body composition as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker is gaining importance
  in various medical fields such as oncology. Therefore, accurate quantification methods
  are necessary, like analyzing CT images. While several studies introduced deep learning
  approaches to automatically segment a single slice, quantifying body composition
  in 3D remains understudied due to the high required annotation effort. This study
  proposes an annotation-efficient strategy using an iterative self-learning approach
  with sparse annotations to develop a segmentation model for the abdomen and pelvis,
  significantly reducing manual annotation needs. The developed model demonstrates
  outstanding performance with Dice scores for skeletal muscle (SM): 0.97+/-0.01,
  inter-/intra-muscular adipose tissue (IMAT): 0.83 +/- 0.07, visceral adipose tissue
  (VAT): 0.94 +/-0.04, and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT): 0.98 +/-0.02. A reader
  study supported these findings, indicating that most cases required negligible to
  no correction for accurate segmentation for SM, VAT and SAT. The variability in
  reader evaluations for IMAT underscores the challenge of achieving consensus on
  its quantification and signals a gap in our understanding of the precision required
  for accurately assessing this tissue through CT imaging. Moreover, the findings
  from this study offer advancements in annotation efficiency and present a robust
  tool for body composition analysis, with potential applications in enhancing diagnostic
  and prognostic assessments in clinical settings.'
