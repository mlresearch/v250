title: Heterogeneous Medical Data Integration with Multi-Source StyleGAN
abstract: Conditional deep generative models have emerged as powerful tools for generating
  realistic images enabling fine-grained control over latent factors. In the medical
  domain, data scarcity and the need to integrate information from diverse sources
  present challenges for existing generative models, often resulting in low-quality
  image generation and poor controllability. To address these two issues, we propose
  Multi-Source StyleGAN (MSSG). MSSG learns jointly from multiple heterogeneous data
  sources with different available covariates and can generate new images controlling
  all covariates together, thereby overcoming both data scarcity and heterogeneity.We
  validate our method on semi-synthetic data of hand-written digit images with varying
  morphological features and in controlled multi-source simulations on retinal fundus
  images and brain magnetic resonance images. Finally, we apply MSSG in a real-world
  setting of brain MRI from different sources. Our proposed algorithm offers a promising
  direction for unbiased data generation from disparate sources. For the reproducibility
  of our experimental results, we provide [detailed code implementation](https://github.com/weslai/msstylegans).
