title: Real-time MR-based 3D motion monitoring using raw k-space data
abstract: Due to its great soft-tissue contrast and non-invasive nature, magnetic
  resonance imaging (MRI) is uniquely qualified for motion monitoring during radiotherapy.However,
  real-time capabilities are limited by its long acquisition times, particularly in
  3D, and require highly undersampling k-space resulting in lower image resolution
  and image artifacts.In this paper, we propose a simple recurrent neural network
  (RNN) architecture to continually estimate target motion from single k-space spokes.By
  directly using the incoming k-space data, additional image reconstruction steps
  are avoided and less data is required between estimations achieving a latency of
  only a few milliseconds.The 4D XCAT phantom was used to generate realistic data
  of the abdomen affected by respiratory and cardiac motion and a simulated lesion
  inserted into the liver acted as the target.We show that using a Kooshball trajectory
  to sample 3D k-space gives superior results compared to a stack-of-stars (SoS) trajectory.The
  RNN quickly learns the motion pattern and can give new motion estimations at a frequency
  of more than 230 Hz, demonstrating the feasibility of drastically improving latency
  of MR-based motion monitoring systems.
