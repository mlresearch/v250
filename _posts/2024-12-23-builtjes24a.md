title: Evaluating ChatGPT’s Performance in Generating and Assessing Dutch Radiology
  Report Impressions
abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, in radiology
  couldoffer insight and interpretation to the increasing number of radiological findings
  generatedby Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, the complexity of medical text
  presents many chal-lenges for LLMs, particularly in uncommon languages such as Dutch.
  This study thereforeaims to evaluate ChatGPT’s ability to generate accurate ‘Impression’
  sections of radiol-ogy reports, and its effectiveness in evaluating these sections
  compared against humanradiologist judgments. We utilized a dataset of CT-thorax
  radiology reports to fine-tuneChatGPT and then conducted a reader study with two
  radiologists and GPT-4 out-of-the-box to evaluate the AI-generated ‘Impression’
  sections in comparison to the originals. Theresults revealed that human experts
  rated original impressions higher than AI-generatedones across correctness, completeness,
  and conciseness, highlighting a gap in the AI’s abil-ity to generate clinically
  reliable medical text. Additionally, GPT-4’s evaluations weremore favorable towards
  AI-generated content, indicating limitations in its out-of-the-boxuse as an evaluator
  in specialized domains. The study emphasizes the need for cautiousintegration of
  LLMs into medical domains and the importance of expert validation, yetalso acknowledges
  the inherent subjectivity in interpreting and evaluating medical reports.
