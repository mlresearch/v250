title: Evaluating Age-Related Anatomical Consistency in Synthetic Brain MRI against
  Real-World Alzheimer’s Disease Data.
abstract: This study examines the realism of medical images created with deep generative
  models, specifically their replication of aging and Alzheimerś disease (AD) related
  anatomical changes. Previous research focused on developing generative methods with
  limited attention to image fidelity. We aim to assess the resemblance of brain MRI
  generated by a StyleGAN3 model with causal controls to neurodegenerative changes.
  For a benchmark, we conducted a visual Turing test (VTT) to see if radiologists
  could distinguish between synthetic and real images. Then, we employed a U-Net-based
  model to segment hallmarks relevant to normal aging and (AD). Finally, we conducted
  statistical tests for our hypothesis that no significant differences existed between
  real and synthetic images. (VTT) results showed radiologists struggled to differentiate
  between image types, highlighting (VTT)ś limitations due to subjectivity and time
  constraints. We found slight hippocampus distribution differences ($\textit{P}$
  = 5.7e-2) and significant lateral ventricle discrepancies ($\textit{P}$s $<$ 5.0e-2),
  indicating higher hippocampus realism and ventricle size inconsistencies. The model
  more effectively simulated changes in the hippocampus than in the lateral ventricles,
  where difficulties were encountered with certain subgroups. We conclude that the
  (VTT) alone is inadequate for a comprehensive quality evaluation, promoting a more
  objective approach. Future research could adapt our approach to evaluate other generated
  medical images intended for different downstream tasks. For reproducibility, we
  provide detailed code implementation$^1$.
