title: 'Unsupervised Domain Adaptation of Brain MRI Skull Stripping Trained on Adult
  Data to Newborns: Combining Synthetic Data with Domain Invariant Features'
abstract: Skull-stripping constitutes a crucial initial step in neuroimaging analysis,
  and supervised deep-learning models have demonstrated considerable success in automating
  this task. However, a notable challenge is the limited availability of publicly
  accessible newborn brain MRI datasets. Furthermore, these datasets frequently use
  diverse post-processing techniques to improve image quality, which may not be consistently
  feasible in all clinical settings. Additionally, manual segmentation of newborn
  brain MR images is labor-intensive and demands specialized expertise, rendering
  it inefficient. While various adult brain MRI datasets with skull-stripping masks
  are publicly available, applying supervised models trained on these datasets directly
  to newborns poses a challenge due to domain shift. We propose a methodology that
  combines domain adversarial models to learn domain-invariant features between newborn
  and adult data, along with the integration of synthetic data generated using a Gaussian
  Mixture Model (GMM) as well as data augmentation procedures. The GMM method facilitates
  the creation of synthetic brain MR images, ensuring a diverse and representative
  input from multiple domains within our source dataset during model training. The
  data augmentation procedures were tailored to make the adult MRI data distribution
  closer to the newborn data distribution. Our results yielded an overall Dice coefficient
  of 0.9308 ± 0.0297 (mean± std), outperforming all compared unsupervised domain adaptation
  models and surpassing some supervised techniques previously trained on newborn data.
