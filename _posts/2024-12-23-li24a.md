title: 'From Barlow Twins to Triplet Training: Differentiating Dementia with Limited
  Data'
abstract: 'Differential diagnosis of dementia is challenging due to overlapping symptoms,
  with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) being the primary method for diagnosis.
  Despite the clinical value of computer-aided differential diagnosis, research has
  been limited, mainly due to the absence of public datasets that contain diverse
  types of dementia. This leaves researchers with small in-house datasets that are
  insufficient for training deep neural networks (DNNs). Self-supervised learning
  shows promise for utilizing unlabeled MRI scans in training, but small batch sizes
  for volumetric brain scans make its application challenging. To address these issues,
  we propose Triplet Training for differential diagnosis with limited target data.
  It consists of three key stages: (i) self-supervised pre-training on unlabeled data
  with Barlow Twins, (ii) self-distillation on task-related data, and (iii) fine-tuning
  on the target dataset. Our approach significantly outperforms traditional training
  strategies, achieving a balanced accuracy of 75.6%. We further provide insights
  into the training process by visualizing changes in the latent space after each
  step. Finally, we validate the robustness of Triplet Training in terms of its individual
  components in a comprehensive ablation study. Our code is available at https://github.com/ai-med/TripletTraining.'
