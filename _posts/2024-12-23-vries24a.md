title: Accelerating physics-informed neural fields for fast CT perfusion analysis
  in acute ischemic stroke
abstract: 'Spatio-temporal perfusion physics-informed neural networks were introduced
  as a new method (SPPINN) for CT perfusion (CTP) analysis in acute ischemic stroke.
  SPPINN leverages physics-informed learning and neural fields to perform a robust
  analysis of noisy CTP data. However, SPPINN faces limitations that hinder its application
  in practice, namely its implementation as a slice-based (2D) method, lengthy computation
  times, and the lack of infarct core segmentation. To address these challenges, we
  introduce a new approach to accelerate physics-informed neural fields for fast,
  volume-based (3D), CTP analysis including infarct core segmentation: ReSPPINN. To
  accommodate 3D data while simultaneously reducing computation times, we integrate
  efficient coordinate encodings. Furthermore, to ensure even faster model convergence,
  we use a meta-learning strategy. In addition, we also segment the infarct core.
  We employ acute MRI reference standard infarct core segmentations to evaluate ReSPPINN
  and we compare the performance with two commercial software packages. We show that
  meta-learning allows for full-volume perfusion map generation in 1.2 minutes without
  comprising quality, compared to over 40 minutes required by SPPINN. Moreover, ReSPPINNÅ›
  infarct core segmentation outperforms commercial software.'
