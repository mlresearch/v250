title: A recurrent network for segmenting the thrombus on brain MRI in patients with
  hyper-acute ischemic stroke
abstract: In the stroke workflow, timely decision-making is crucial. Identifying,
  localizing, and measuring occlusive arterial thrombi during initial imaging is a
  critical step that triggers the choice of therapeutic treatment for optimizing vascular
  re-canalization. We present a recurrent model that segments the thrombus in patients
  suffering from a hyper-acute stroke. A cross-attention module is defined to merge
  the diffusion and susceptibility-weighted modalities available in Magnetic Resonance
  Imaging (MRI), which are fed to a modified version of the Convolutional Long-Short-Term
  Memory (CLSTM) model. It detects almost all the thrombi with a Dice higher than
  0.6. The lesion segmentation prediction reduces the false positives to almost zero
  and the performance is comparable between distal and proximal occlusions.
