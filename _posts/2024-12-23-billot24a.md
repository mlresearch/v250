title: Network conditioning for synergistic learning on partial annotations
abstract: The robustness and accuracy of multi-organ segmentation networks is limited
  by the scarcity of labels. A common strategy to alleviate the annotation burden
  is to use partially labelled datasets, where each image can be annotated for a subset
  of all organs of interest. Unfortunately, this approach causes inconsistencies in
  the background class since it can now include target organs. Moreover, we consider
  the even more relaxed setting of region-based segmentation, where voxels can be
  labelled for super-regions, thus causing further inconsistencies across annotations.
  Here we propose CoNeMOS (Conditional Network for Multi-Organ Segmentation), a framework
  that leverages a label-conditioned network for synergistic learning on partially
  labelled region-based segmentations. Conditioning is achieved by combining convolutions
  with expressive Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layers, whose parameters are
  controlled by an auxiliary network. In contrast to other conditioning methods, FiLM
  layers are stable to train and add negligible computation overhead, which enables
  us to condition the entire network. As a result, the network can learn where it
  needs to extract shared or label-specific features, instead of imposing it with
  the architecture (e.g., with different segmentation heads). By encouraging flexible
  synergies across labels, our method obtains state-of-the-art results for the segmentation
  of challenging low-resolution fetal MRI data. Our code is available at https://github.com/BBillot/CoNeMOS.
