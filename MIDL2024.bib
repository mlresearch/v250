                  from July 3 to 5, 2024, in Paris, France and it was
                  organized by co-chairs Ninon Burgos, Caroline
                  Petitjean and Maria Vakalopoulou from Centre
                  national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) - Paris

                  CentraleSupélec Université Paris Saclay,
                  respectively. The scientific program was organized
                  by a team of program chairs from CentraleSupelec,
                  CNRS - LaBRI, Inria Sophia-Antipolis, CNRS - CREATIS
                  and Centrale Nantes - LS2N.

                  Similar to the previous
                  editions of the conference, MIDL 2024 had two
                  submission tracks: full papers and short papers. 181
                  valid full papers and 124 short papers underwent a
                  transparent review process through the OpenReview
                  platform. Both the full paper and short paper track
                  review processes were single-blind. The papers and
                  reviews are publicly available through OpenReview,
                  the papers with a final decision of rejection were
                  not listed in the OpenReview platform.  The full
                  paper submissions underwent a rigorous single-blind
                  review process that involved a team of 5 Program
                  Chairs (PC), 27 Area Chairs (AC), and 202
                  reviewers. For each submission at least 3 reviews
                  were ensured. After desk rejection of incomplete
                  submissions by PC, each of the remaining 217 papers
                  received at least three reviews as well as a
                  meta-review by an AC, and the authors were allowed
                  to respond to the reviews during a rebuttal
                  period. The PC then discussed each borderline paper
                  over a virtual meeting to make the accept/reject
                  decisions and to select oral presentations. The
                  acceptance rate of the full paper track was $54 \%$,
                  with 36 oral presentations and 81 posters.

                  The
                  short paper submissions underwent a more streamlined
                  single-blind review process involving a team of the
                  same 5 PCs and 25 reviewers, most of whom had also
                  served as AC for the full paper track. Of the 170
                  submissions, 105 were accepted as posters.

                  We want
                  to thank the Area Chairs and reviewers for their
                  careful reviews and constructive feedback to the

Will this joint learning benefit performance on the sets of modalities and pathologies available during training? Will it enable analysis of new databases with different sets of modalities and pathologies? We develop and compare different methods and show that promising results can be achieved with appropriate, simple and practical alterations to the model and training framework. We experiment with 7 databases containing 5 types of brain pathologies and different sets of MRI modalities. Results demonstrate, for the first time, that joint training on multi-modal MRI databases with different brain pathologies and sets of modalities is feasible and offers practical benefits. It enables a single model to segment pathologies encountered during training in diverse sets of modalities, while facilitating segmentation of new types of pathologies such as via follow-up fine-tuning. The insights this study provides into the potential and limitations of this paradigm should prove useful for guiding future advances in the direction.

To do so, these methods separate the latent space into a set of \textbf{salient} features (\textit{i.e.,} proper to the target dataset) and a set of \textbf{common} features (\textit{i.e.,} exist in both datasets). Currently, all CA-VAEs models fail to prevent sharing of information between the latent spaces and to capture all salient factors of variation. To this end, we introduce two crucial regularization losses: a disentangling term between common and salient representations and a classification term between background and target samples in the salient space.

Annotating three-dimensional medical images is a time-consuming and costly process. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel semi-supervised segmentation method that leverages mostly unlabeled images and a small set of labeled images in training. Our approach involves assessing prediction uncertainty to identify reliable predictions on unlabeled voxels from the teacher model. These voxels serve as pseudo-labels for training the student model. In voxels where the teacher model produces unreliable predictions, pseudo-labeling is carried out based on voxel-wise embedding correspondence using reference voxels from labeled images.We applied this method to automate hip bone segmentation in CT images, achieving notable results with just 4 CT scans. The proposed approach yielded a Hausdorff distance with 95th percentile (HD95) of 3.30 and IoU of 0.929, surpassing existing methods achieving HD95 (4.07) and IoU (0.927) at their best.",

A temporal ordering is imposed such that the distance of a scan from the decision hyperplane of the AMD stage classifier is inversely related to its time-to-conversion. In addition, an intra-subject temporal consistency in the predicted conversion risk scores is ensured by incorporating a pair of longitudinal scans from the same eye during training. We evaluated our proposed method on a longitudinal dataset comprising 235 eyes (3,534 OCT scans) with 40 converters. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving an average area under the ROC of 0.84 for predicting conversion within the next 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.

    abstract = "Skull-stripping constitutes a crucial initial step in neuroimaging analysis, and supervised deep-learning models have demonstrated considerable success in automating this task. However, a notable challenge is the limited availability of publicly accessible newborn brain MRI datasets. Furthermore, these datasets frequently use diverse post-processing techniques to improve image quality, which may not be consistently feasible in all clinical settings. Additionally, manual segmentation of newborn brain MR images is labor-intensive and demands specialized expertise, rendering it inefficient. While various adult brain MRI datasets with skull-stripping masks are publicly available, applying supervised models trained on these datasets directly to newborns poses a challenge due to domain shift. We propose a methodology that combines domain adversarial models to learn domain-invariant features between newborn and adult data, along with the integration of synthetic data generated using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as well as data augmentation procedures. The GMM method facilitates the creation of synthetic brain MR images, ensuring a diverse and representative input from multiple domains within our source dataset during model training. The data augmentation procedures were tailored to make the adult MRI data distribution closer to the newborn data distribution. Our results yielded an overall Dice coefficient of 0.9308 ± 0.0297 (mean± std), outperforming all compared unsupervised domain adaptation models and surpassing some supervised techniques previously trained on newborn data.

Despite improvements in deep learning architectures for tumor segmentation over the years, creating a fully autonomous system suitable for clinical floors remains a formidable challenge because the model predictions have not yet reached the desired level of accuracy and generalizability for clinical applications. Generative modeling techniques have seen significant improvements in recent times. Specifically, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have been used to generate higher-quality images with fewer artifacts and finer attributes. In this work, we introduce a framework called Re-Diffinet for modeling the discrepancy between the outputs of a segmentation model like U-Net and the ground truth, using DDPMs. By explicitly modeling the discrepancy, the results show an average improvement of 0.55\% in the Dice score and 16.28\% in 95\% Hausdorff Distance from cross-validation over 5-folds, compared to the state-of-the-art U-Net segmentation model.

    abstract = "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art architecture in representation learning, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to excel in various tasks. ViTs split images into fixed-size patches, constraining them to a predefined size and necessitating pre-processing steps like resizing, padding, or cropping. This poses challenges in medical imaging, particularly with irregularly shaped structures like tumors. A fixed bounding box crop size produces input images with highly variable foreground-to-background ratios. Resizing medical images can degrade information and introduce artifacts, impacting diagnosis. Hence, tailoring variable-sized crops to regions of interest can enhance feature representation capabilities. Moreover, large images are computationally expensive, and smaller sizes risk information loss, presenting a computation-accuracy tradeoff. We propose VariViT, an improved ViT model crafted to handle variable image sizes while maintaining a consistent patch size. VariViT employs a novel positional embedding resizing scheme for a variable number of patches. We also implement a new batching strategy within VariViT to reduce computational complexity, resulting in faster training and inference times. In our evaluations on two 3D brain MRI datasets, VariViT surpasses vanilla ViTs and ResNet in glioma genotype prediction and brain tumor classification. It achieves F1-scores of 75.5\% and 76.3\%, respectively, learning more discriminative features. Our proposed batching strategy reduces computation time by up to 30\% compared to conventional architectures. These findings underscore the efficacy of VariViT in image representation learning.",

While existing solutions for the non-IID problem often do not quantify the degree of non-IID nature between clients in the federation, assessing it can improve training experiences and outcomes, particularly in real-world scenarios with unfamiliar datasets. The paper presents a practical non-IID assessment methodology for a medical segmentation problem, highlighting its significance in medical FL. We propose a simple yet effective solution that utilizes distance measurements in the embedding space of medical images and statistical measurements calculated over their metadata. Our method, designed for medical imaging and integrated into federated averaging, improves model generalization by downgrading the contribution from the most distant client, treating it as an outlier. Additionally, it enhances model personalization by introducing distance-based clustering of clients. To the best of our knowledge, this method is the first to use distance-based techniques for providing a practical solution to the non-IID problem within the medical imaging FL domain. Furthermore, we validate our approach on three public FL imaging radiology datasets (FeTS, Prostate, and Fed-KITS2019) to demonstrate its effectiveness across various radiology imaging scenarios.",

However, existing methods still suffer from low accuracy in polyp boundary delineation and insufficient suppression of irrelevant background due to the blur boundaries and textures of polyps. To overcome these limitations, in this paper a Pyramid Attention Augmented Network (PAAN) is proposed, in which a pyramid feature diversion structure with spatial attention mechanism is developed so that good feature representation with low information loss can be achieved by conducting channel attention-based feature diversion and inter-layer fusion, while reducing computational complexity. Also, our framework includes an Enhanced Spatial Attention module (ESA), which can improve the quality of initial polyp segmentation predictions through spatial self-attention mechanism and multi-scale feature fusion. Our approach is evaluated on five challenging polyp datasets— Kvasir, CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-300, ETIS, and CVC-colonDB and achieves excellent results.

While deep learning has shown promise in automating vertebral fracture detection, improving the interpretability of existing methods is crucial for building trust and ensuring reliable clinical application. Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer inherent interpretability through attention visualizations but are limited in their application to 3D medical images due to reliance on 2D image pretraining. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach combining the benefits of transfer learning from video-pretrained models and domain adaptation with self-supervised pretraining on a task-specific but unlabeled dataset. Compared to naive transfer learning from Video MAE, our method shows improved downstream task performance by 8.3 in F1 and a training speedup of factor 2. This closes the gap between videos and medical images, allowing a ViT to learn relevant anatomical features while adapting to the task domain. We demonstrate that our framework enables ViTs to effectively detect vertebral fractures in a low data regime, outperforming CNN-based state-of-the-art methods while providing inherent interpretability. Our task adaptation approach and dataset not only improve the performance of our proposed method but also enhance existing self-supervised pretraining approaches, highlighting the benefits of task-specific self-supervised pretraining for domain adaptation.

    abstract = "The robustness and accuracy of multi-organ segmentation networks is limited by the scarcity of labels. A common strategy to alleviate the annotation burden is to use partially labelled datasets, where each image can be annotated for a subset of all organs of interest. Unfortunately, this approach causes inconsistencies in the background class since it can now include target organs. Moreover, we consider the even more relaxed setting of region-based segmentation, where voxels can be labelled for super-regions, thus causing further inconsistencies across annotations. Here we propose CoNeMOS (Conditional Network for Multi-Organ Segmentation), a framework that leverages a label-conditioned network for synergistic learning on partially labelled region-based segmentations. Conditioning is achieved by combining convolutions with expressive Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layers, whose parameters are controlled by an auxiliary network. In contrast to other conditioning methods, FiLM layers are stable to train and add negligible computation overhead, which enables us to condition the entire network. As a result, the network can learn where it needs to extract shared or label-specific features, instead of imposing it with the architecture (e.g., with different segmentation heads). By encouraging flexible synergies across labels, our method obtains state-of-the-art results for the segmentation of challenging low-resolution fetal MRI data.

Building upon recent advancements in foundation Vision-Language Models (VLMs) from natural image-text pairs, several studies have proposed adapting them to Vision-Language Segmentation Models (VLSMs) that allow using language text as an additional input to segmentation models. Introducing auxiliary information via text with human-in-the-loop prompting during inference opens up unique opportunities, such as open vocabulary segmentation and potentially more robust segmentation models against out-of-distribution data.Although transfer learning from natural to medical images has been explored for image-only segmentation models, the joint representation of vision-language in segmentation problems remains underexplored. This study introduces the first systematic study on transferring VLSMs to 2D medical images, using carefully curated $11$ datasets encompassing diverse modalities and insightful language prompts and experiments. Our findings demonstrate that although VLSMs show competitive performance compared to image-only modelsfor segmentation after finetuning in limited medical image datasets, not all VLSMs utilize the additional information from language prompts, with image features playing a dominant role. While VLSMs exhibit enhanced performance in handling pooled datasets with diversemodalities and show potential robustness to domain shifts compared to conventional segmentation models, our results suggest that novel approaches are required to enable VLSMs to leverage the various auxiliary information available through language prompts.

However, these methods face significant challenges when directly applied to pathological images due to the subtle color differences between nuclei and tissues, as well as the significant morphological variations among nuclei.

To address the above problem, this paper proposes a boundary-aware contrastive learning network to denoise the boundary noise in a semi-supervised nuclei segmentation task. The model has two key designs: a low-resolution denoising (LRD) module and a cross-RoI contrastive learning (CRC) module. The LRD improves the smoothness of the nuclei boundary by pseudo-labels denoising, and the CRC enhances the discrimination between foreground and background by boundary feature contrastive learning.

This specialization results in a better initialization for the subsequent optimization process. By broadcasting the encodings to fill our modulation weight matrices, we greatly reduce the required size of the encoder compared to approaches that predict the complete weight matrices directly. Additionally, our method retains the flexibility to infuse arbitrarily large encodings.

While this is promising for clinical screening tasks, reconstruction-based UAD methods fall short in segmentation accuracy compared to supervised models. Therefore, self-supervised UAD approaches have been proposed to improve segmentation accuracy. Typically, synthetic anomalies are used to train a segmentation network in a supervised fashion. However, this approach does not effectively generalize to real pathologies. We propose a framework combining reconstruction-based and self-supervised UAD methods to improve both segmentation performance for known anomalies and generalization to unknown pathologies. The framework includes an unsupervised diffusion model trained on healthy data to produce pseudo-healthy reconstructions and a supervised Unet trained to delineate anomalies from deviations between input- reconstruction pairs. Besides the effective use of synthetic training data, this framework allows for weakly-supervised training with small annotated data sets, generalizing to unseen pathologies. Our results show that with our approach, utilizing annotated data sets during training can substantially improve the segmentation performance for in-domain data while maintaining the generalizability of reconstruction-based approaches to pathologies unseen during training.",

The main difficulty arises from the use of registration loss functions that are inadequate in the absence of corresponding regions. In this work, we present the first registration and segmentation approach tailored to this challenge. In particular, we assume the practically highly relevant scenario that only a limited number of segmentations are available for one modality and none for the other. First, we augment our few segmented samples using unsupervised deep registration within one modality, thereby providing many anatomically plausible samples to train a segmentation network. The resulting segmentation network then allows us to train a segmentation network on the target modality without available segmentations by using an unsupervised domain adaptation architecture. Finally, we train a deep registration network to register multimodal image pairs purely based on predictions of their segmentation networks. Our work demonstrates that using a small number of segmentations from one modality enables training a segmentation network on a target modality without the need for additional manual segmentations on that modality. Additionally, we show that registration based on these segmentations provides smooth and accurate deformation fields on anatomically different image pairs, unlike previous methods.

Several studies have tried to recover such information from multiple X-ray images of the same object. Still, those approaches often fail due to the unrealistic assumption that the target does not move between views and those two views are perfectly orthogonal.A problem where 3D information would be highly valuable but is very difficult to assess from 2D X-ray images is the measurement of the actual 3D fracture angles in the forearm. To address this problem, we propose a deep learning-based method that predicts the rotational movement and skeletal posture from biplanar X-ray images, offering a novel and precise solution.Our strategy comprises the following steps: (1) automatic segmentation of the ulna and radius bones of the forearm on two X-ray images by a neural network; (2) prediction of the rotational parameters of the bones by a pose prediction network; (3) automatic detection of fracture locations and assessment of the fracture angles on 2D images; and (4) reconstruction of the real 3D fracture angle by inferring it from the 2D fracture information and the skeleton pose parameters collected from the two images. Our experiments on X-ray images show that our method can accurately measure 2D fracture angles and infer the pose of the forearm bones. By simulating X-ray images for various types of fractures, we show that our method could provide more accurate measurements of fracture angles in 3D. We are the first attempt for the fully automatic fracture angle measurements on both 2D and 3D versions, and we show the robustness of our method even in extreme cases where the two views are highly nonorthogonal.",

Deep learning algorithms have been emerging as popular tools for denoising LDCT images, where they typically rely on large data sets requiring data from multiple centers. However, LDCT images collected from different centers (clients) can present significant data heterogeneity, and the sharing of them between clients is also constrained by privacy regulations. In this work, we propose a personalized federated learning (FL) approach for enhancing model generalization across different organ images from multiple local clients while preserving data privacy. Empirically, we find that earlier FL methods tend to underperform single-set models on non-IID LDCT data due to the presence of data heterogeneity characterized by varying frequency patterns. To address this, we introduce a Federated Learning with Frequency Domain Decomposition (FedFDD) approach, which decomposes images into different frequency components and then updates high-frequency signals in an FL setting while preserving local low-frequency characteristics. Specifically, we leverage an adaptive frequency mask with discrete cosine transformation for the frequency domain decomposition. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on LDCT datasets of different organs and our experimental results show that FedFDD can surpass state-of-the-art FL methods as well as both localized and centralized models, especially on challenging LDCT denoising cases.

Vertebra structures are not fully resolved in these images, and multi-image superresolution by aligning scans to pair them is difficult due to partial volume effects and inter-vertebral movement during acquisition.

We generate synthetic training pairs by multiple degradation functions that model the data shift and acquisition errors between sagittal slices and sagittal views of axial images. Our method employs modeling of the k-space point spread function and the interslice gap. Further, we imitate different MR acquisition challenges like histogram shifts, bias fields, interlace movement artifacts, Gaussian noise, and blur. This enables the training of diffusion-based superresolution models on scaling factors larger than 6$\times$ without real paired data. The low z-resolution in axial images prevents existing approaches from separating individual vertebrae instances. By applying this superresolution model to the z-dimension, we can generate images that allow a pre-trained segmentation model to distinguish between vertebrae and enable automatic segmentation and processing of axial images.

    abstract = "Solving the domain shift problem during inference is essential in medical imaging as most deep-learning based solutions suffer from it. In practice, domain shifts are tackled by performing Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), where a model is adapted to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging the labelled source domain. In medical scenarios, the data comes with huge privacy concerns making it difficult to apply standard UDA techniques. Hence, a closer clinical setting is Source-Free UDA (SFUDA), where we have access to source trained model but not the source data during adaptation. Methods trying to solve SFUDA typically address the domain shift using pseudo-label based self-training techniques. However due to domain shift, these pseudo-labels are usually of high entropy and denoising them still does not make them perfect labels to supervise the model. Therefore, adapting the source model with noisy pseudo labels reduces its segmentation capability while addressing the domain shift. To this end, we propose a two-stage approach for source-free domain adaptive image segmentation: 1) Target-specific adaptation followed by 2) Task-specific adaptation. In the Stage-I, we focus on learning target-specific representation and generating high-quality pseudo labels by leveraging a proposed ensemble entropy minimization loss and selective voting strategy. In Stage II, we focus on improving segmentation performance by utilizing teacher-student self-training and augmentation-guided consistency loss, leveraging the pseudo labels obtained from Stage I. We evaluate our proposed method on both 2D fundus datasets and 3D MRI volumes across 7 different domain shifts where we achieve better performance than recent UDA and SF-UDA methods for medical image segmentation.

    abstract = "Chest X-ray analysis in medical imaging has largely focused on single-view methods. However, recent advancements have led to the development of multi-view approaches that harness the potential of multiple views for the same patient. Although these methods have shown improvements, it is especially difficult to collect large multi-view labeled datasets owing to the prohibitive annotation costs and acquisition times. Hence, it is crucial to address the multi-view setting in the low data regime. Pre-training is a critical component to ensure efficient performance in this low data regime, as evidenced by its improvements in natural and medical imaging. However, in the multi-view setup, such pre-training strategies have received relatively little attention and ImageNet initialization remains largely the norm. We bridge this research gap by conducting an extensive benchmarking study illustrating the efficacy of 10 strong supervised and self-supervised models pre-trained on both natural and medical images for multi-view chest X-ray classification. We further examine the performance in the low data regime by training these methods on 1\%, 10\%, and 100\% fractions of the training set. Moreover, our best models yield significant improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art multi-view approaches, outperforming them by as much as 9.9\%, 8.8\% and 1.6\% on the 1\%, 10\%, and 100\% data fractions respectively. We hope this benchmark will spur the development of stronger multi-view medical imaging models, similar to the role of such benchmarks in other computer vision and medical imaging domains.

This provides an ideal environment for artificial intelligence (AI) assisted surgery. For the development of such AI components, the need for expert annotations remains a key bottleneck. In this paper, we study the application of self-supervised learning (SSL) on surgical data. In a self-supervised setting, a representation backbone is trained on information that is inherently present in the data. There is no need for annotations, leaving the backbone free to train on all recordings, not just labeled ones. We leveraged optical flow for weighting pairs in a view-contrastive self-supervised learning loss. Constructed as an Info Noise-Contrastive Estimation (InfoNCE) loss, it contrasted the pixel representations of two differently, photometrically and geometrically transformed views. The importance of each contrasted pixel pair is determined by computing the difference between the optical flows of the respective pixels. In this way, the optical flow guided the representations of pixels that move together to similar vectors. We tested the usefulness of the representation vectors by training simple networks for semantic segmentation or robotic instrument key point detection. These networks showed competitive performance, even when using over 92\% fewer annotated samples than other works. For semantic segmentation, we used as little as 99.73\% fewer samples for training, originating from the m2caiSeg dataset, and remained competitive even when testing on the unseen cholecSeg8k dataset.",

We then validated it on our target task, age-related WMH detection, on ADNI3 and on a curated clinical dataset from a single-site neuroradiology department, for which we had manually delineated lesion masks. Next, we applied the fine-tuned $\beta$-VAE for anomaly detection in a CDW characterised by an exceptional heterogeneity in terms of hospitals, scanners and image quality. We found a correlation between the Fazekas scores extracted from the radiology reports and the volumes of the lesions detected by our model, providing a first insight into the performance of VAEs in a clinical setting. We also observed that our model was robust to image quality, which strongly varies in the CDW. However, despite these encouraging results, such approach is not ready for an application in clinical routine yet due to occasional failures in detecting certain lesions, primarily attributed to the poor quality of the images reconstructed by the VAE.",

Our approach employs SAM to refine segmentation results from ICL model and leverages ICL model to generate prompts for SAM, eliminating the need for manual prompt provision. Additionally, we introduce a semantic confidence map gener- ation method into our framework to guide the prediction of both ICL model and SAM, thereby further enhancing segmentation accuracy. Our method has been extensively eval- uated across multiple medical imaging contexts, including fundus, MRI, and CT images, spanning five datasets.

Here, we study these potential dataset-centric prediction variations using two popular chest x-ray datasets, CheXpert (CXP) and MIMIC-CXR (MMC). While CXP-trained models generally perform better on CXP than MMC test data and vice versa, this performance decrease is not uniform across individual images. We find that image-level variations in predictions are not random but can be inferred well above chance, even for pathologies where the overall performance gap is small, suggesting that there are systematic tendencies of models trained on different datasets. Furthermore, these \"predictive tendencies\" are not solely explained by image statistics or attributes like radiographic position or patient sex, but rather are pathology-specific and related to higher-order image characteristics. Our findings stress the complexity of AI robustness and generalization, highlighting the need for a nuanced approach that especially considers the diversity of pathology presentation.},

This operation eliminates most sources of domain variation, therefore overestimating their actual ability to cope with new, unseen patterns. In this paper, we analyze the most recent and accurate methods for domain generalization in OD/OC segmentation by applying them on uncropped fundus pictures, observing notorious degradations in their performance when trained and evaluated under this setting.To overcome their drawbacks, we also introduce a simple semi-supervised learning approach for domain generalization based on the Noisy Student framework.Using a Teacher model trained on a combination of domains, we pseudo-labeled a dataset of 18.000 originally unlabeled images that are then used for training a Student model.This semi-supervised setting allowed the Student network to capture additional sources of variability while retaining the original cues and patterns used by the Teacher through the weak annotations.Our results on eight different public datasets show improvements in every unseen domain over all alternative methods, and are available in https://github.com/eugeniaMoris/Noisy\_student\_ODOC\_MIDL\_2024.",

Traditional pixel-wise and regression-based methods primarily encounter difficulties in precise segmentation and lack of geometrical grounding respectively. To address these shortcomings, our methodology refines the segmentation by predicting a signed distance function (SDF) that effectively parameterizes the retinal layer shape via level set. We further enhance the framework by integrating probabilistic modeling, applying Gaussian distributions to encapsulate the uncertainty in the shape parameterization. This ensures a robust representation of the retinal layer morphology even in the presence of ambiguous input, imaging noise, and unreliable segmentations. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate superior performance when compared to other methods. Additionally, we conducted experiments on artificially distorted datasets with various noise types—shadowing, blinking, speckle, and motion—common in OCT scans to showcase the effectiveness of our uncertainty estimation.

The study introduces a novel data augmentation method for MIL, sequentially altering features from original and augmented images during training loops. This method improved the average area under curve (AUC) from 0.43, 0.64 and 0.81 for ResNet50, DenseNet121 and REMEDIS foundation model, respectively (training without any augmentation), to 0.61, 0.87 and 0.91 with the proposed augmentation strategy.The top-performing model, using REMEDIS foundation model as the backbone, achieved 0.93 AUC and 0.83 balanced accuracy to predict aneuploidy in the test cohort biopsies (n=279). Across all the patients (n=123), predicted aneuploidy status was correlated with progression to EAC (p=6.55e-06), similar to correlation with ploidy status based on flow cytometry results (p=2.84e-7). Supporting the findings, histologic nuclear features typically associated with dysplasia and DNA content abnormalities such as enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei and loss of nuclear polarity, were seen in the samples called abnormal compared to the control diploid samples.In conclusion, our deep learning model efficiently predicts aneuploidy, a mechanism that has been shown to underpin BE progression to EAC.

This paper presents FluidRegNet, a convolutional neural network for the registration of successive optical coherence tomography images of the retina. The correspondence between time points is established by predicting the position of the origin of the fluids by creating a fluid seed in the form of sparse intensity offsets in the moving image and registering the fluid seed to the affected area in the follow-up image.

Despite many recent advancements, existing sequencing-based methods have a spatial resolution that limits identification of individual cells.  To address this, several cell type deconvolution methods have been proposed to integrate spatial gene expression with single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing, producing per spot cell typing. However, these methods often overlook the contribution of morphology, which means cell identities are randomly assigned to the nuclei within a spot. In this paper, we introduce MHAST, a morphology-guided hierarchical permutation-based framework which efficiently reassigns cell types in spatial transcriptomics. We validate our method on simulated data, synthetic data, and a use case on the broadly used Tangram cell type deconvolution method with Visium data. We show that deconvolution-based cell typing using morphological tissue features from self-supervised deep learning lead to a more accurate annotation of the cells.",

This task is particularly important in reading chest X-ray images because radiologists often compare multiple images of the same patient taken at different times to track disease progression and changes in its severity in their clinical practice. However, previous works focused on designing specific network architectures for the diff-VQA task, missing opportunities to enhance the model\'s performance using a pretrained vision-language model (VLM). Here, we introduce a novel VLM called PLURAL, which is pretrained on natural and longitudinal chest X-ray data for the diff-VQA task. The model is developed using a step-by-step approach, starting with being pretrained on natural images and texts, followed by being trained using longitudinal chest X-ray data. The longitudinal data consist of pairs of X-ray images, along with question-answer sets and radiologist’s reports that describe the changes in lung abnormalities and diseases over time. Our experimental results show that the PLURAL model outperforms state-of-the-art methods not only in diff-VQA for longitudinal X-rays but also in conventional VQA for a single X-ray image. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VLM architecture and pretraining method in improving the model’s performance.",

A person\'s X-ray, even with proper anonymisation applied, can readily serve as fingerprint and would enable a highly accurate re-identification of the same individual in a large pool of scans. Common practices for reducing privacy risks involve a synthetic deterioration of image quality, e.g. by adding noise or downsampling images, before sharing them publicly. Yet, this also adversely affects the quality of downstream image recognition models trained on such datasets. We propose a novel strategy for finding a better compromise of model quality and privacy preservation by means of implicit neural obfuscation. Our method jointly overfits a neural network to a small batch of patients\' X-ray scans and applies a substantial compression - the number of network parameters representing the images is more than 6x smaller than the original images. In addition, we introduce a k-anonymity mixing that injects partial information from other patients for each reconstruction. That way identifiable information is efficiently obfuscated, while we manage to maintain the quality of relevant image parts for the intended downstream task. Experimental validation on the public RANZCR CLiP dataset demonstrates improved segmentation quality and up to 3 times reduced privacy risks compared to a more basic image obfuscation baselines. In contrast to other recent work that learn specific anonymous representations, which no longer resemble visually meaningful scans, our approach remains interpretable and is not tied to a certain downstream network.

This study proposes an annotation-efficient strategy using an iterative self-learning approach with sparse annotations to develop a segmentation model for the abdomen and pelvis, significantly reducing manual annotation needs.

Moreover, applying 2D SAM to 3D images requires prompting the entire volume, which is time- and label-consuming. To address these problems, we propose Slide-SAM, which treats a stack of three adjacent slices as a prediction window. It firstly takes three slices from a 3D volume and point- or bounding box prompts on the central slice as inputs to predict segmentation masks for all three slices. Subsequently, the masks of the top and bottom slices are then used to generate new prompts for adjacent slices. Finally, step-wise prediction can be achieved by sliding the prediction window forward or backward through the entire volume. Our model is trained on multiple public and private medical datasets and demonstrates its effectiveness through extensive 3D segmetnation experiments, with the help of minimal prompts.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can mitigate this problem by generating synthetic images to augment training datasets. However, GANs sometimes are unstable and struggle to produce high-resolution, realistic, and diverse images. An alternative solution is Diffusion Probabilistic Models, but these models require extensive computational resources. Additionally, most of the existing generation models are designed to generate the entire image volumes, rather than the regions of interest (ROIs) such as the tumor region. Research on brain tumor classification using magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) has shown that it is easier to classify the ROIs compared to the entire image volumes. To this end, we present a class-conditioned ROI generation framework that combines a conditional vector-quantization GAN and a class-conditioned masked Transformer to generate high-resolution and diverse 3D brain tumor ROIs. We also propose a temporal-agnostic masking strategy to effectively learn relationships between semantic tokens in the latent space.

This study aims to leverage a blind deconvolution strategy through a deep-learning approach to address the saturation in the AIF.Methods: We propose the utilization of a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with the saturated AIF and a set of myocardial tissue signals as inputs, generating the corrected AIF as the output. To train the network, a dataset comprising over 3×10^6 simulated AIFs with associated signals from five simulated tissues response for each instance was employed. To assess the effectiveness of the approach, the trained network was evaluated using a dual-saturation sequence to compare the corrected AIF with the unsaturated version.

In the in vivo dataset, the coefficient of determination R2 was 0.26 and 0.86 for the saturated and corrected AIF, respectively, in comparison to the unsaturated AIF.Conclusion: The proposed network successfully corrects the acquisition-induced effects on the AIF.

For this purpose, the shapes of cardiac MRI reconstructions are learned to model the spatial relation of multiple chambers.

Developing automatic computer-aided methods for analyzing embryo images is highly desirable. However, effectively fusing multiple FP-images for prediction remains a largely under-explored issue. To this end, we propose a novel Multiple Focal-plane Image Fusion Network, called MFIF-Net, to predict implantation outcomes of blastocyst. Specifically, our MFIF-Net consists of two sub-networks: a Core Image Generation Network (CI-Gen) and a Key Feature Fusion Network (KFFNet). In CI-Gen, we fuse multiple FP-images to generate a core image by pixel-wise weighting since different FP-images can have different focus positions. To further capture key features in each FP-image, we propose KFFNet to extract key information from the FP-images again and fuse them with the core image. In KFFNet, a Fusion Module is designed to capture key information of each FP-image, for which Squeeze Multi-Headed Attention is developed to exchange features and mitigate computationally intensive issues in attention.

The experiments also show that the proposed MO DIR approach provides a better spread of DIR outputs across the entire trade-off front than simply training multiple neural networks with weights for each objective sampled from a grid of possible values.",

This hinders the application of SAM for volumetric medical scans since at least one prompt per class for each single slice is needed. In our work, the applicability is improve by reducing the number of necessary user-generated prompts. We introduce and evaluate multiple training-free strategies to automatically place box prompts in bone CT volumes, given only one initial box prompt per class. The average performance of our methods ranges from 54.22\% Dice to 88.26\% Dice. At the same time, the number of annotated pixels is reduced significantly from a few millions to two pixels per class.

    abstract = "The increased interest and importance of explaining neural networks\' predictions, especially in the medical community, associated with the known unreliability of saliency maps, the most common explainability method, has sparked research into other types of explanations. Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) emerge as an alternative, with the advantage of being inherently understandable by humans and the standard way that radiologists explain their diagnoses. We extend upon previous work on NLE generation for multi-label chest X-ray diagnosis by replacing the traditional decoder-only NLE generator with an encoder-decoder architecture. This constitutes a first step towards Reinforcement Learning-free adversarial generation of NLEs when no (or few) ground-truth NLEs are available for training, since the generation is done in the continuous encoder latent space, instead of in the discrete decoder output space.However, in the current scenario, large amounts of annotated examples are still required, which are especially costly to obtain in the medical domain, given that they need to be provided by clinicians. Thus, we explore how the recent developments in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) can be leveraged for this use-case. We compare different PEFT methods and find that integrating the visual information into the NLE generator layers instead of only at the input achieves the best results, even outperforming the fully fine-tuned encoder-decoder-based model, while only training 12\% of the model parameters. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate the viability of supervising the NLE generation process on the encoder latent space, thus laying the foundation for RL-free adversarial training in low ground-truth NLE availability regimes.

However, current models largely operate within a binary classification paradigm with findings either present or absent using fixed decision thresholds, whereas many clinical findings can be more usefully described on a scale of severity which a skilled radiologist will incorporate into a more nuanced report. This limitation is due, in part, to the difficulty and expense of manually annotating fine-grained labels for training and test images versus the relative ease of automatically extracting binary labels from the associated free text reports using NLP algorithms. In this paper we examine the ability of models trained with only binary training data to give useful abnormality severity information from their raw outputs. We assess performance on a ranking task using manually ranked test sets for each of five findings: cardiomegaly, consolidation, paratracheal hilar changes, pleural effusion and subcutaneous emphysema. We find the raw model output agrees with human-assessed severity ranking with Spearman\'s rank coefficients between 0.563 - 0.848. Using patient age as an additional radiological finding with full ground truth ranking available, we go on to compare a binary classifier output against a fully supervised RankNet model, quantifying the reduction in training data required in the fully supervised setting for equivalent performance. We show that model performance is improved using a semi-supervised approach supplementing a smaller set of fully supervised images with a larger set of binary labelled images.",

However, significant individual variation in the organisation of the human cerebral cortex makes it difficult to identify population-level trends in these signals. Recently, Surface Vision Transformers (SiTs) have emerged as a promising approach for modelling cortical signals, yet they face some limitations in low-data scenarios due to the lack of inductive biases in their architecture. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the surface Masked AutoEncoder (sMAE) and video surface Masked AutoEncoder (vsMAE) - for multivariate and spatio-temporal pre-training of cortical signals over regular icosahedral grids. These models are trained to reconstruct cortical feature maps from masked versions of the input by learning strong latent representations of cortical structure and function. Such representations translate into better modelling of individual phenotypes and enhanced performance in downstream tasks. The proposed approach was evaluated on cortical phenotype regression using data from the young adult Human Connectome Project (HCP) and developing HCP (dHCP). Results show that (v)sMAE pre-trained models improve phenotyping prediction performance on multiple tasks by $\ge 26\%$, and offer faster convergence relative to models trained from scratch.

We combine this with classical low-level perturbations like adding noise and downsampling to further enable low-level representation learning.

Several autoencoder-based approaches have been used to solve UAD tasks. However, most of these approaches do not have any constraints to ensure the removal of pathological features while restoring the healthy regions in the pseudo-healthy image reconstruction. To remove the occurrence of pathological features, we propose to utilize an Autoencoder which deploys a masking strategy to reconstruct images. Additionally, the masked regions need to be meaningfully inpainted to enforce global and local consistency in the generated images which makes transformer-based masked autoencoder a potential approach. Although the transformer models can incorporate global contextual information, they are often computationally expensive and dependent on a large amount of data for training. Hence we propose to employ a Swin transformer-based Masked Autoencoder (MAE) for anomaly detection (Ano-swinMAE) in brain MRI. Our proposed method Ano-swinMAE is trained on a  healthy cohort by masking a certain percentage of information from the input images. While inferring, a pathological image is given to the model and different segments of the brain MRI slice are sequentially masked and their corresponding generation is accumulated to create a map indicating potential locations of pathologies.

One such is shortcut learning, where a network erroneously learns to depend on a fragile spurious feature, such as a text label added to the image, rather than scrutinizing the genuinely useful regions of the image. In this way, systems can exhibit misleadingly high test-set results while the labels are present but fail badly elsewhere where the relationship between the label and the spurious feature breaks down. In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to detect shortcut learning and locate where the shortcut is happening in a neural network. We propose a novel methodology utilizing the sample difficulty metric Prediction Depth (PD) and KL divergence to identify specific layers of a neural network model where the learned features of a shortcut manifest. We demonstrate that our approach can effectively isolate these layers across several shortcuts, model architectures, and datasets. Using this, we show a correlation between the visual complexity of a shortcut, the depth of its feature manifestation within the model, and the extent to which a model relies on it.

These pixel-wise measures are sometimes susceptible to local minima, providing sub-optimal and inconsistent quality evaluation. Moreover, it might be essential to incorporate semantic features crucial for human visual perception of the registration quality. Towards this end, we propose a data-driven approach to learn the semantic similarity between the registered and target images to ensure a perceptual and consistent evaluation of the registration quality. In this work, we train a Siamese network to classify registered and synthetically misaligned pairs of images. We leverage the latent Siamese encodings to formulate a semantic registration evaluation metric, SiamRegQC. We analyze SiamRegQC from different perspectives: robustness to local minima or smoothness of evaluation metric, sensitivity to smaller misalignment errors, consistency with visual inspection, and statistically significant evaluation of registration algorithms with a p-value $<$ 0.05. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SiamRegQC on two downstream tasks; (i) Rigid registration of 2D histological serial sections, where evaluating sub-pixel misalignment errors is critical for accurate 3D volume reconstruction. SiamRegQC provides a more realistic quality evaluation sensitive to smaller errors and consistent with visual inspection illustrated with more perceptual semantic feature maps rather than pixel-wise MSE maps.

The second network employs an uncertainty-aware descriptor to refine the representation of uncertain regions, enhancing the accuracy of predictions. Additionally, to adaptively recalibrate the representation of uncertain candidates, we define class prototypes based on reliable predictions. We then aim to minimize the discrepancy between class prototypes and uncertain predictions through a deep contrastive learning strategy.Our experimental results on organ segmentation from clinical MRI and CT scans demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

    abstract = "Medical image synthesis generates additional imaging modalities that are costly, invasive or harmful to acquire, which helps to facilitate the clinical workflow. When training pairs are substantially misaligned (e.g., lung MRI-CT pairs with respiratory motion), accurate image synthesis remains a critical challenge. Recent works explored the directional registration module to adjust misalignment in generative adversarial networks (GANs); however, substantial misalignment will lead to 1) suboptimal data mapping caused by correspondence ambiguity, and 2) degraded image fidelity caused by morphology influence on discriminators. To address the challenges, we propose a novel Deformation-aware GAN (DA-GAN) to dynamically correct the misalignment during the image synthesis based on multi-objective inverse consistency. Specifically, in the generative process, three levels of inverse consistency cohesively optimise symmetric registration and image generation for improved correspondence. In the adversarial process, to further improve image fidelity under misalignment, we design deformation-aware discriminators to disentangle the mismatched spatial morphology from the judgement of image fidelity. Experimental results show that DA-GAN achieved superior performance on a public dataset with simulated misalignments and a real-world lung MRI-CT dataset with respiratory motion misalignment. The results indicate the potential for a wide range of medical image synthesis tasks such as radiotherapy planning.",

    abstract = "Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a potentially vision-threatening condition, necessitates accurate diagnosis and staging, which deep-learning models can facilitate. However, these models often struggle with robustness in clinical practice due to distribution shifts caused by variations in data acquisition protocols and hardware. We propose RADR, a novel deep-learning framework for DR severity classification, aimed at generalization across diverse datasets and clinic cameras. Our work builds upon existing research: we combine several ideas to perform extensive dataset curation, preprocessing, and enrichment with camera information. We then use a domain adversarial training regime, which encourages our model to extract features that are both task-relevant and invariant to domain shifts. We explore our framework in its various levels of complexity in combination with multiple data augmentations policies in an ablative fashion. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving competitive performance to multiple state-of-the-art models on three unseen external datasets.",

ISCTs are valuable in developing and evaluating novel treatments targeting acute ischemic stroke (AIS), a prominent contributor to both mortality and disability rates.

In this work, we propose and evaluate diffusion-based generative modeling and set transformers to generate a population of synthetic intracranial vessel tree centerlines with associated radii and vessel types. We condition our model on the presence of an occlusion in the middle cerebral artery, a frequently occurring occlusion location in AIS patients. Our analysis of generated synthetic populations shows that our model accurately produces diverse and realistic cerebral vessel trees that represent the geometric characteristics of the real population.",

    abstract = "In the rapidly evolving field of nuclei segmentation, there is an increasing trend towards developing a universal segmentation model capable of delivering top-tier results across diverse datasets. While achieving this is the ultimate goal, we argue that such a model should also outperform dataset-specific specialized models. To this end, we propose a task-specific feature sensitive U-Net model, that sets a baseline standard in segmentation of nuclei in histopathological images. We meticulously select and optimize the underlying U-Net3+ model, using adaptive feature selection to capture both short- and long-range dependencies. Max blur pooling is included to achieve scale and position invariance, while DropBlock is utilized to mitigate overfitting by selectively obscuring feature map regions. Additionally, a Guided Filter Block is employed to delineate fine-grained details in nuclei structures. Furthermore, we apply various data augmentation techniques, along with stain normalization, to reduce inconsistencies and thus resulting in significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art performance and paving the way for precise nuclear segmentation essential for cancer diagnosis and possible treatment strategies.",

It remains uncertain if general augmentation policies suit surgical applications. In this work, we automate the search for suitable augmentation policies through a new method called Dimensionality Driven Augmentation Search (DDA). DDA leverages the local dimensionality of deep representations as a proxy target, and differentiably searches for suitable data augmentation policies in contrastive learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DDA in navigating a large search space and successfully identifying an appropriate data augmentation policy for laparoscopic surgery. We systematically evaluate DDA  across three laparoscopic image classification and segmentation tasks, where it significantly improves over existing baselines. Furthermore, DDA\'s optimised set of augmentations provides insight into domain-specific dependencies when applying contrastive learning in medical applications. For example, while hue is an effective augmentation for natural images, it is not advantageous for laparoscopic images.",

Excessive radiation poses health risks, particularly for pediatric patients, but despite the imperative to reduce radiation doses, conventional image processing methods for X-ray denoising often struggle with heuristic parameter calibration and prolonged execution times. Deep Learning solutions have emerged as promising alternatives, but their effectiveness varies, and challenges persist in preserving image quality.This paper presents an exploration of diffusion models for planar X-ray image denoising, a novel approach that to our knowledge has not been yet investigated in this domain. We perform real time denoising of Poisson noise while preserving image resolution and structural similarity. The results indicate that diffusion models show promise for planar X-ray image denoising, offering a potential improvement in the optimization of diagnostic utility amid dose reduction efforts.",

    abstract = "On account of superiority in annotation efficiency, multiple instance learning (MIL) has proved to be a promising framework for the whole slide image (WSI) classification in pathological diagnosis. However, current methods employ fully- or semi-decoupled frameworks to address the trade-off between billions of pixels and limited computational resources. This exacerbates the information bottleneck, leading to instance representations in a high-rank space that contains semantic redundancy compared to the potential low-rank category space of instances. Additionally, most negative instances are also independent of the positive properties of the bag. To address this, we introduce a weakly annotation-supervised filtering network, aiming to restore the low-rank nature of the slide-level representations. We then design a parallel aggregation structure that utilizes spatial attention mechanisms to model inter-correlation between instances and simultaneously assigns corresponding weights to channel dimensions to alleviate the redundant information introduced by feature extraction. Extensive experiments on the private gastrointestinal chemotaxis dataset and CAMELYON16 breast dataset show that our proposed framework is capable of handling both binary and multivariate classification problems and outperforms state-of-the-art MIL-based methods.

    author = "Robin Trombetta and Olivier Rouvi\`ere and Carole Lartizien",
    abstract = "Fully supervised deep models have shown promising performance for many medical segmentation tasks. Still, the deployment of these tools in clinics is limited by the very time-consuming collection of manually expert-annotated data. Moreover, most of the state-of-the-art models have been trained and validated on moderately homogeneous datasets. It is known that deep learning methods are often greatly degraded by domain or label shifts and are yet to be built in such a way as to be robust to unseen data or label distributions. In the clinical setting, this problematic is particularly relevant as the deployment institutions may have different scanners or acquisition protocols than those from which the data has been collected to train the model. In this work, we propose to address these two challenges on the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) from bi-parametric MRI. We evaluate the method proposed by (Kervadec et al., 2018) , which introduces a size constaint loss to produce fine semantic cancer lesions segmentations from weak circle scribbles annotations. Performance of the model is based on two public (PI-CAI and Prostate158) and one private databases. First, we show that the model achieves on-par performance with strong fully supervised baseline models, both on in-distribution validation data and unseen test images. Second, we observe a performance decrease for both fully supervised and weakly supervised models when tested on unseen data domains. This confirms the crucial need for efficient domain adaptation methods if deep learning models are aimed to be deployed in a clinical environment. Finally, we show that ensemble predictions from multiple trainings increase generalization performance.",

    abstract = "The identification of mitotic figures (MFs) is a routine task in the histopathological assessment of tumor malignancy with known limitations for human observers. For a machine learning pipeline to robustly detect MFs, it must overcome a variety of conditions such as different scanners, staining protocols, tissue configurations, and organ types. In order to develop a deep learning-based algorithm that can cope with these challenges, there are two obstacles that need to be overcome: obtaining a large-scale dataset of MF annotations spread across different domains of interest, including whole slide images (WSIs) exhaustively annotated for MFs, and using the annotated MFs in an efficient training process to extract the most relevant features for classification.Our work attempts to address both of these challenges and establishes an MF detection pipeline trained solely on animal data, yet competitive on the mixed human/animal MIDOG22 dataset, and, in particular, on human breast cancer.First, we propose a processing pipeline that allows us to strengthen the true scanner robustness of our dataset by physically rescanning the glass slides of annotated WSIs and registering MF positions. To enable the use of such rescans for training, we propose a novel learning paradigm tailored for labels that match partially, which allows to account for ambiguous MF positions in the rescans caused by spurious, suboptimal fine-focus on potential MFs by the scanner. Second, we demonstrate how a multi-task learning approach for MF subtypes, including the prediction of atypical mitotic figures (AMFs), can significantly enhance a model\'s ability to distinguish MFs from imposters. Our algorithm, using a standard object detection pipeline, performs very competitively with an average test set F1 value across five runs of 0.80 on the MIDOG22 training set. We also demonstrate its ability to stratify overall survival on the TCGA-BRCA dataset based on mitotic density, though it falls short of reaching significance in stratifying survival based on AMFs.",
